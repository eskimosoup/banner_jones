INSERT INTO `articles` VALUES (1,'Cash Flow is King','It was announced last week that the UK economy has officially come out of recession with figures for the last three months of 2009 showing growth of 0.1%.','<p>Unemployment figures also fell last week for the first time in 18 months. Despite this encouraging news the reality for most businesses is that things will remain difficult for some time yet. Further factory closures such as Robert Bosch Limited in Wales, provide yet another stark reminder that the UK manufacturing sector, in particular, continues to be under threat from cheaper overseas production.</p>\n<p>The recent tough economic climate has given many business managers the opportunity to review overheads and cut out unnecessary costs. This is often the easiest way to make a business more profitable.&nbsp; One simple yet practical example is to ensure that correspondence is sent electronically rather than by post whenever possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For businesses that do find they are facing insolvency, whereby, a business is unable to pay their debts as and when they fall due, seeking professional advice at the earliest opportunity can help to safeguard the long term future and stability of the business.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When it comes to financial management the phrase <em>&ldquo;cash flow is king&rdquo;</em> is often used and for good reason.&nbsp; Many good businesses fail as a result of poor cash flow management.&nbsp; The key is to monitor both your creditors and debtors carefully; if cash flow becomes problematic speak to creditors early and try to initiate informal arrangements to defer payments temporarily.&nbsp; For example, HM Revenue &amp; Customs have been more prepared to agree deferred payment plans with businesses struggling to pay their tax bills than previously. If your business operates from rented premises then you should consider contacting your landlord with a view to negotiating a reduction in the rent. From a landlord&rsquo;s point of view, agreeing to accept a reduced rent is preferable to having empty premises or having to issue proceedings against a tenant to recover arrears.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With debtors, be similarly proactive, in the event of a default of payment immediate attempt to negotiate a repayment arrangement should be made.&nbsp; If payments are not been made legal advice should be sought with a view to instigating proceedings.&nbsp; The threat of legal proceedings will often be sufficient for a debtor to make payment.&nbsp; Care should also be taken in not extending significant credit to clients and customers.&nbsp; Whilst fulfilling orders keeps a business busy, you should be careful not to leave yourself overexposed with even the most longstanding of customers.</p>\n<p>For businesses that do get into financial difficulties the options that are available include the following, IVAs&rsquo; (Individual Voluntary Arrangements) &amp; CVAs&rsquo; (Company Voluntary Arrangements). The&nbsp;basic principle of IVAs&rsquo; &amp; CVAs&rsquo; is that the business in difficulty puts a&nbsp;proposal to its creditors to pay them a fixed amount in the pound of the debts owing.&nbsp; If the arrangement is accepted by the creditors then this allows the business to continue with reduced debt levels.&nbsp; Where debt is held individually rather than in a limited company name it can be more troublesome as the personal assets of the business owner, including their home can be under threat.</p>\n<p>Another option is Pre-Pack Administration &ndash; A Pre-Pack Administration is where the managers of an insolvent business agree terms with an Administrator to purchase the assets of the business with the Company being placed into Administration immediately after that.&nbsp; This form of corporate recovery can be controversial as a &lsquo;Phoenix&rsquo; business often begins to trade under a similar name by the same people, from the same premises having written off the debts of the previous business.&nbsp; In those circumstances maintaining trading relationships is often difficult however the other side of this argument is that in many cases, were the action not to have been taken, the business would have failed with the consequent loss of jobs and with creditors left in no better position.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Debt recovery comes in many guises from full scale insolvencies including company voluntary arrangements, partnership and individual voluntary arrangements down to simple debt negotiation and dispute resolution. Don&rsquo;t leave it too late to put your Debt Recovery plan in place because if a business is found to have traded whilst insolvent, then the Directors of that business can be made personally liable for any further debts incurred during that time.

Research shows that around three fifths of UK companies with a turnover up to £5m are in fact family run businesses.','<p>We hear a lot about the struggle to achieve a &ldquo;work life balance&rdquo; but family businesses have been taking their work home for decades. A 2009 survey carried out by South Yorkshire accountants Hawsons revealed that for 44% of family business discussions take place &ldquo;when and wherever&rdquo; and for a further 19% discussions take place &ldquo;at home&rdquo;. The Sunday Lunch Board Meeting is a common phenomenon in the family business; however, this can lead to issues of exclusion for directors, managers and owners who are not family members and also resentment from family members who are not involved in the business.</p>\n<p>Only 30% of family businesses survive to the second generation because sibling rivalry over contentious issues such as share ownership, succession and salaries all get in the way of forward business planning.&nbsp; As a family business grows and different generations start to join many family businesses take the decision to create a Family Charter (sometimes called family constitutions or protocols). This is a written document which creates a framework to support the formal business structures, and typically sets out how the family wishes the business to be run, the family&rsquo;s goals and the long-term strategy, the family&rsquo;s relationships within the business and how the family members should behave towards each other in the context of the business.</p>\n<p>The charter can also cover such issues as, who should be employed in the business? Who should be entitled to sit on the board? What happens if someone wants to sell their shares? And should in-laws be entitled to own shares?</p>\n<p>Having a Family Charter in place can boost overall staff morale through the knowledge that they are fully supported by the family rather than being treated as outsiders.&nbsp;&nbsp; No two Family Charters will be the same, but the process of working together to create a Family Charter can help the family and the business achieve long term growth objectives.</p>\n<p>So where will your family business be at the end of this new decade?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should you be taking stock and seeking professional advice on how to future proof your business?</p>','2010-12-13',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','2010-12-17 10:30:18','2010-12-17 10:30:18',1,NULL,0,NULL,1,0,'admin'),(3,'Change of status...','Many new business start ups are either sole traders or partnerships but at some stage many of those will become a limited company.   The question is, are you better off being a sole trader or in a partnership rather than being a limited company (Ltd) or limited liability partnership (LLP)?','<p>Quite often the format for running your business will have depended on your personal circumstances at the time of start up, but circumstances change as your business grows and it might be worth reviewing your options. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One of the major benefits from incorporating your business into a Ltd company/LLP is limited liability. This means that providing the rules are followed individuals will not take on personal liability for contracts and creditors.&nbsp;&nbsp; In these uncertain economic times this is not only an advantage for existing businesses but also for any budding Alan Sugar apprentices setting up a new business.&nbsp; Often a Ltd company will operate a number of separate divisions although these are still all part of the same Ltd company. You could also consider having a group structure.&nbsp; This protects an established profitable business from a new or untested business venture as each part of the group enjoys the protection of limited liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Care must be taken though, where &nbsp;the &lsquo;small profits rate&rsquo; for corporation tax has to be divided between associated companies.</p>\r\n<p>Roles in the business can be reviewed at this time especially when incorporating an existing partnership business into a Ltd company. This has tax planning benefits, as a shareholding director of a Ltd company can receive a salary, dividends and loan repayments.&nbsp; A &ldquo;silent partner&rdquo; may become a shareholder (&ldquo;investor&rdquo;) but not a director (&ldquo;manager&rdquo;) and key employees can become directors but not shareholders.&nbsp; Employees can &lsquo;participate&rsquo; and have non-voting shares and have a stake in the business without having any control. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>LLPs have been overlooked by many businesses despite the fact that they offer limited liability status with partnership style taxation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LLPs have been popular with many professional businesses which traditionally operated as a partnership, often due to the regulatory requirements of their governing body. &nbsp;We have a number of clients who successfully use both an LLP and Ltd for different aspects of their businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course having several types of business being run alongside one another does require more administration but the benefits can far outweigh the extra costs which may arise. One of the benefits to having both a Ltd company and a partnership is that it allows income sources to adapt quickly and tax efficiently which might be important following some of the potential changes in the first &ldquo;ConDemNation&rdquo; budget.&nbsp; We may see reductions to the small profits rate of corporation tax, changes to tax thresholds, NI rates and various other tweaks to the taxation system. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are however some perceived disadvantages to incorporation but this does not discourage over 300,000 new companies being formed every year.&nbsp;&nbsp; The public register at Companies House holds a Ltd&rsquo;s/LLP&rsquo;s accounts, however, as the accounts filing deadline is 9 months after the year end the information in these accounts may be out of date and of limited commercial value.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, it is common for banks, landlords and finance companies to still require personal guarantees whilst the newly formed Ltd company/LLP establishes a credit history.&nbsp; Where possible any personal guarantee should be limited to an agreed sum.&nbsp;&nbsp; In reality you are still better off providing a limited form of personal guarantee than having the unlimited liability associated with sole trader status.&nbsp; In terms of cost it is not expensive to set up a new Ltd company/LLP as the registration fees are just &pound;20 for the DIY route. It is recommended however, that you have a professionally prepared agreement regulating Ltd companies, LLPs and partnerships which will mean that the overall costs will be roughly the same. This is why most people choose to use a specialist solicitor or company formation agent so that they avoid potentially expensive mistakes and get the correct agreements in place from the start.</p>\r\nIf you are a new/start up business and would be interested in some advice on this subject why not come along to our free breakfast seminar at the Derbyshire &amp; Nottinghamshire Chamber of Commerce in Chesterfield on the 11<sup>th</sup> June at 8am.

Income and Corporation taxes are top the list so that income can be extracted efficiently. Capital gains tax also on the list, especially for those preparing their business for sale. But what about Inheritance tax (IHT)?','<p>Many business owners will be pleased to learn that they can make use of &ldquo;Business Property Relief&rdquo; which means that HM Revenue &amp; Customs will ignore certain business assets when calculating IHT. There are of course rules but if for the past several years you have owned the shares in your limited company which is a genuine trading company then the chances are that the value of the shares will be ignored when dealing with IHT on your death.</p>\n<p>Many business owners find that they have lost the right to this relief without realising.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the limited company has rented out its business premises with the result that the greater part of the company&rsquo;s income now comes from rental activity rather than trading activities. This may enough to result in the relief being denied or disputed with the result that your executors have to spend time and legal fees challenging tax authority&rsquo;s decision. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Selling your business can also result in an immediate loss of relief. For those fortunate enough to find a cash buyer then having sold the business you will no longer qualify for the relief &ndash; you now have a cash deposit in your bank account not shares in a trading company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many business sales are structured so that the final purchase price is dependent upon an earn out - the seller continuing to work in the business for an agreed time after the sale. We also see sellers trying to assist buyers with structures allowing the purchase to take place over an extended period of time. The IHT treatment will depend upon what you owned at the date of death &ndash; shares in a trading company or a right to receive payment for those shares at a future date &ndash;&nbsp;and the nature of the business activities undertaken by the company.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The valuable Business Property Relief can be wasted &ndash; if the business assets (which qualify in their own right as exempt from IHT) are left in a Will to an IHT exempt beneficiary (such as a spouse or registered charity) then this is not tax efficient.</p>\n<p>Inheritance tax is rarely at the forefront of anyone&rsquo;s mind when buying, running or selling a business. However with the prospect of a 40% tax bill on the value of your business assets perhaps it is time to review your business structure and draw up your IHT efficient Will, with a qualified solicitor of course.</p>','2010-09-30',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','2010-12-17 10:40:25','2010-12-17 10:40:25',1,NULL,0,NULL,1,0,'admin'),(6,'Businesses Need More Than a Crystal Ball','How long has your business been around? Will it be here in 10 years? What about 100 years? To learn some lessons about businesses surviving through difficult economic times take a look at your local family owned businesses, particularly those who have survived through 3 or more generations. To survive the transition through several decades requires not only a very long term view but also a desire to ensure that there is a sound business there for the generations to come.','<p>To survive through generations the business obviously needs to have a robust business strategy and we often find that excellence in customer service is often something that distinguishes a family owned business. By looking after and retaining their existing customers rather than constantly trying to acquire new ones has given many family owned businesses a point of difference and solid foundation to work from.</p>\n<p>But this is only one element.&nbsp; All businesses need to ensure they have access to capital.&nbsp;&nbsp; Older family owned businesses are particularly good at maintaining profits and cash in the business. This enables reinvestment into the company and helps maintain balance through turbulent economic times.&nbsp; It helps to have close family relationships with a sense of belonging and also to have no external shareholders demanding dividend returns is an advantage.</p>\n<p>In the knowledge that the business will benefit at the end of the mortgage term, very often we see family owned businesses buying their premises rather than renting. The commercial property market is still very touch but if a business has managed to maintain sufficient cash reserves to enable a sizeable deposit to be put down then purchasing premises is still something to consider to reap &nbsp;those longer term benefits. We also often see family businesses owning their premises separately to the business, which gives them the security that the wealth in the property is separate to the main business should they ever wish to diversify into newer riskier ventures.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many of our business clients have told us that they are trying to counteract the recession by going back to basics, focusing on looking after their customers, getting the job done quickly (at the right price of course) and making sure they get paid promptly for it. Hopefully we will all remember some of these valuable lessons as the economy struggles back.

Trying to ensure that a business is in good shape to trade this year, next year and in 5 years time requires long term strategic planning.</p>\n<p>Some of the best examples of business longevity are family businesses.&nbsp; The names may evolve along with the product ranges but the culture behind the business continues. Many family businesses look to the long term future &ndash; trying to ensure that there will be a business fit for the next generation to take over in 20 years time. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Having a clear understanding about what is expected from the next generation is key. Do your children, nephews and nieces have the automatic right to join the business? Many children are lured into the family business by the promise of a comfortable salary and title status, where all too often the recipient neither has the skills nor experience to warrant this. This can undermine the position of the rest of the senior management team when faced with taking orders from the inexperienced boss&rsquo;s son or daughter.&nbsp; Should you therefore have eligibility criteria for joining the business such as relevant skills training? A family construction business for example would be better served by an architecture or civil engineering qualification, so an agreement as to the further education needs of the next generation may take place whilst they are still at school, ensuring their skills are aligned to the business profile.</p>\nPlanning for retirement is something we are all encouraged to think about as soon as we start working, however, family businesses will also need to plan for succession, not just in terms of financing an exit for the current owners but also in terms of ensuring that the next generation have the right attributes for the future success of the business.

Let me help you to secure a deal. Middle-class homebuyers are finding it harder than ever to secure a mortgage as high street lenders tighten criteria for securing a loan.','<p>Last week, the British Bankers&rsquo; Association (BBA) warned that the number of newloans for house purchases had hit a 19-month low, while total mortgage lending wasat its lowest for a decade. One frustrated broker said that few of his applications forNatWest&rsquo;s best-buy two-year tracker, with a rate of 1.99%, had been approved. Thebank then came back with question marks on every single one. One broker said that onlyabout 10% of clients meet the requirements set by lenders for new borrowers. Peopleare now not even bothering to apply for a mortgage as they feel their chances of gettingaccepted are just too slim.</p>\r\n<p>There are currently 972 mortgage deals available from the biggest seven lenders &mdash; HSBC, RBS (including NatWest), Lloyds Banking Group (including Halifax), Barclays,Santander (including Abbey and Alliance &amp; Leicester), Northern Rock and Nationwidebuilding society &mdash; compared with 411 in 2006, according to Moneyfacts, the data provider. However, while the number of mortgages available has risen, applications being approved have slumped. The BBA figures show 70,895 loans were approved lastmonth, against 195,976 in 2006. Some borrowers who have secured a deal are havingfinance withdrawn at the eleventh hour after they have paid valuation and applicationfees. Agreements in principle (AIPs) are traditionally provided by lenders after an initialcredit check and assessment of a borrower&rsquo;s application, giving the green light to payvaluers and lawyers. However, AIPs are becoming less reliable and people shouldn&rsquo;tassume that they will still stand in two months.</p>\r\n<p>The sickly state of the mortgage market continues to push down house prices, which fell0.8% last month, according to the Land Registry. Here&rsquo;s how borrowers at every stage ofthe housing market have been hit by the squeeze and how they can secure the best deal.</p>\r\n<h2>Applying For a Loan</h2>\r\n<p>The mortgage drought is forcing middle-class borrowers to seek pricier loans fromalternative &ldquo;sub-prime&rdquo; lenders. There are now a number of such lenders includingKensington, Aldermore and Precise, which joined the market with new deals last week.Melton Mowbray building society also improved its deals in the past few days. Lendingconstraints on the high street are forcing creditworthy high earners to use alternativefirms that charge higher rates. These lenders will accept applications from borrowerswith county court judgments (CCJs) or missed loan repayments. However, one lendersaid that an increasing number of their customers are high earners who have been shutout of the mainstream market. The average new borrower earns &pound;42,000 a year, withone in ten earning more than &pound;60,000. In 2007, it was mainly cash-poor borrowerswho turned to alternative lenders.</p>\r\n<p>Precise introduced three-year capped tracker-rate loans last week for borrowers withone payment default in the past three years. It charges those with a 25% deposit avariable rate of 5.26%, pegged to Libor &mdash; the rate at which banks lend to eachother &mdash; and capped at 8.25%, with a 1.5% fee. By contrast, Chelsea buildingsociety has a three-year fixed rate at just 3.29% with a &pound;995 fee, available toborrowers with a 25% deposit. The increased use of computerised underwritingprocedures at the biggest lenders means that any blip on a credit report history,however minor, could lead to a rejection. However, borrowers without a spotlesshistory should not have to go straight to alternative lenders.

These concerns are beginning to come more to the fore.

Interest-only mortgages will come under review next year. First-timebuyers already face serious obstacles to home ownership. Lenders are demandingsubstantial deposits and refusing loans or increasing interest rates for those who cannotraise them. I heard this week that ministers are deeply concerned that the pendulum infavour of regulation may have swung too far, storing up the potential for economic andsocial problems at a time when lending is already at a ten-year low. First-time buyersand those struggling with repayments are particularly vulnerable to the threat of higherinterest rates in the new year.</p>\r\n<p>The number of first-time buyers in the three months to September was 5 per cent lowerthan in the same period of 2009, as most lenders continue to shun those with a 10 percent deposit or charge exorbitant premiums of between 3 and 5 per cent. TheGovernment insists the rise in tuition fees to be decided this week, potentially saddlinggraduates with &pound;40,000 of debt, will not have an impact on their ability to borrow, butsome mortgage brokers have called this into question. Ministers believe the FSA iswrong to suggest that the changes will have a tiny impact on mortgage take-up, andthe Treasury is being warned that new regulations would encourage excessively riskaverse decision-making by banks. They have seized on Council of Mortgage Lenders(CML) estimates that show that under the proposals, 60 per cent of first-time buyerswould have been affected if the rules had been in place between 2005 and 2009. TheCML also calculates that 45 per cent of first-time buyers granted mortgages in the firsthalf of this year would have been rejected or allowed to borrow only a lesser amount ifthe mortgage rules had been in force. Overall, CML figures show that mortgage lendingwill be &pound;9 billion this year, compared with &pound;41 billion in 2008 and &pound;110 billion in 2006,as banks struggle to rebuild their balance sheets. However, the FSA has pointed out thatthe 350,000 borrowers in arrears and the 54,000 repossessions last year meant that itmust ensure that there was no return to risky lending.</p>\r\n<p>Two major charities, Citizens Advice and Shelter, said they supported the FSA&rsquo;s proposalsto introduce tough income and affordability checks on mortgage borrowers. An FSAspokeswoman said it was aware of the sensitivity of the issue. &ldquo;We are not rushing orimplementing changes right now, and we are incredibly mindful of the impact.&rdquo;Mark Hoban, the Treasury Minister, has told the Commons that he believes the FSA mustlook &ldquo;very carefully at the impact on home ownership and particularly on those peoplewho are looking to move shortly&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Grant Shapps, the Housing Minister, said he did not want the FSA micro-managing themarket. &ldquo;I welcome this review of the mortgage market, not least because we can seehow terribly things went wrong in the past,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is crucial, however, to ensurethat the review addresses the problems of the future, rather than trying to fix the gaping holes of the past.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, said: &ldquo;We must have amortgage market that is capable of responding to the increasing diversity and flexibilityof the UK labour market.

It was signed by almost 5,000 landlords after a campaign by Paul Shamplina, founder of eviction specialists Landlord Action, and the Residential Landlords Association, together with Sussex MP Mike\r\nWeatherley. The petition is aimed at speeding up the eviction process when there is clear evidence of anti-social behaviour or arrears on the part of the tenants.','<p>The landlords are also seeking changes to the law to improve their rights ofaccess to their property, and they want assurances that the proposed closures of54 county courts will not adversely affect landlords. Alan Ward, chairman of theResidential Landlords Association, said: &ldquo;Landlords depend on the county courtsto dispense justice when tenants fail to pay the rent. If these courts are closed,we call on the Secretary of State for Justice to ensure that landlords and tenantsare not disadvantaged by delays in the court system.&rdquo; Paul Shamplina, ofLandlord Action, said: &ldquo;The private rented sector is growing and the Governmentneeds landlords to plug the shortfall in housing stock. Therefore, it&rsquo;s vital thatthere is a legal framework that properly supports them and encouragesinvestment within this sector.&rdquo; Mike Weatherley said: &ldquo;I wholeheartedly supportthis entirely sensible plan to balance the rights of landlords and tenants. It is alltoo easy to forget that landlords can be mistreated, just as tenants can be.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>What they haven&rsquo;t covered off is the issue of Housing Benefit. It used to be thecase that Councils would pay the rent of someone receiving Housing Benefitdirect to the Landlord. Now rent is paid to the Tenant.

That to me is insanity andif we are to prepare for a property market driven by rent rather than mortgagesthen the rules need to be changed. Former racing driver Sir Stirling Moss, alandlord with 40 properties, recently had to go through the full legal process toevict tenants who had not paid rent for seven months.

On average, rents are now 9.9% more than mortgage payments.Research by Zoopla compares current asking prices to average rents for twobedroomflats in the 50 largest cities and towns around the country. Mortgagepayments were calculated assuming an interest-only mortgage at 5% p.a. In somelocations, the extra cost of renting is staggering. In York, rents exceed mortgagepayments by 39%: with average monthly rents at &pound;978, York tenants are &pound;3,270a year worse off than if they were buying. In a further 13 of the largest 50 citiesand towns, rents exceed mortgage payments by more than 20%.</p>\r\n<h2>Tenants Who Can\'t Afford To Buy Squeezed By Rising Rents</h2>\r\n<p>I\'m&nbsp;not sure the rental market in Chesterfield is as buoyant as it is nationally.Generally rents appear to have reduced over the last two years rather thanincreased. However, four in ten tenants believe rents will be higher in 12 months&rsquo;time.

Meanwhile, with rentalstock down 23% compared with a year ago, Rightmove says there is chance ofa let-up in rent rises. Commercial director Miles Shipside said that are cases ofgazumping in some areas, and he described some tenants as &ldquo;trapped renters&rdquo;.He said they were unable to get on the housing ladder because of high depositsand credit scoring criteria.

The fuller assessment looks at 11 different areas of the person&rsquo;s health and their care needs to decide where is the best place for them to live. This includes looking at their mobility, their breathing, their continence, their mental state etc. There are 4 possible outcomes of the assessment &ndash; the person could return home, move into residential care, need residential care with some nursing, or need full nursing care. If the person is assessed as needing the last of these options then the costs of their care will be paid in full by the NHS.

Got a contingency plan?','If you have a business, a partnership or are a company director then you should consider appointing a Power Of Attorney. This allows you to delegate decision-making to your attorney if for any reason you can’t be there to make the decisions yourself. You can limit their power to a specific time frame and also limit the decisions they are able to make for you. For example, if a lease for new premises needs to be signed on the 29th of the month, when you will be in the south of France, you can nominate someone to have power to sign that specific lease on that specific day.','<p>You can also give a much wider power to someone like your business partner. This would mean they can step into your shoes whenever they are needed to sign papers or make decisions at any point in the future, say if you were ill. In fact, when 2 or 3 people are in business together this would be a sensible step to take, to ensure business continuity.</p>\r\n<p>Appointing an attorney can be important in your personal life as well, particularly if you have lots of assets/investments. What if something happened to you tomorrow and you could no longer write a cheque, or sort out your direct debits, even get cash out of the bank... what would you do? People can lose the ability to do all these things in all sorts of ways &ndash; a skiing accident, a car crash, a stroke, dementia or even a routine stay in hospital!</p>\r\n<p>By creating a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) you can choose someone you trust to take charge of your finances if you need them to. You can choose more than one person if you like, or one person with a &ldquo;back up&rdquo;, just in case. The LPA must be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian before it can be used. But once that has been done, it can take effect whenever and as often as you need it. It can last for the rest of your life or whatever other timescale you choose.</p>\r\n<p>Obviously, by giving someone power to look after your finances like this there are risks. Your attorney would have complete control and could sell your house and all your assets. There are 2 main ways of safeguarding against this. Firstly, when the LPA is registered you can choose up to 5 people who must be told. These people can act as &ldquo;whistleblowers&rdquo; and speak up if they suspect anything is amiss. Secondly, you can place restrictions on your LPA to prevent your attorney from doing certain things. We would however, always urge caution on restrictions though as your circumstances can change and what might not be appropriate now, may be necessary in the future. For example, you might not want your attorney to be able to sell your house right now. But what if 10 years from now you had a stroke and needed residential care? It might be essential that they have power to sell your house in those circumstances.</p>\r\n<p>To be able to set up a LPA you must have the necessary understanding of what is involved. Sadly, many people leave it too late and come to us &ndash; or, rather, their families do - to set one up when they have advanced memory problems or dementia. If you don&rsquo;t have the necessary &lsquo;mental capacity&rsquo; then you can&rsquo;t create a LPA. How many times do we hear &ldquo;Oh, if only we had come to you sooner&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>So don&rsquo;t leave it too late. We like to think of a LPA like an insurance policy.

The death of trusts for grandchildren has been widely reported over recent years but as quoted by Mark Twain, reports of their death may have been exaggerated. Certainly the tax treatment of trusts has become more onerous but for each grandparent wishing to set aside a maximum of say &pound;100,000 which will be &ldquo;used up&rdquo; by the time the grandchild reaches the age of 18, tax treatment may not be as significant as press reports would have us believe.</p>\n<p>The creation of a discretionary trust for the benefit of grandchildren can still be a useful tool.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the selection of appropriate trustees grandparents can have the assurance that this pot of money is ring fenced and can only be used for certain purposes and not by the parents of the grandchildren.</p>\n<p>Treating your grandchildren fairly (rather than equally) may also be an issue, as it is possible that some of your grandchildren may need your support more than others. On the other side of the family there maybe other sets of grandparents who are willing to assist with school fees and you might want to take this into account so wealth is shared fairly.&nbsp; By using independent trustees you can ensure fairness is taken into account when making decisions about fees in the future.</p>\n<p>Grandparents are often concerned that without their continuing financial assistance a grandchild&rsquo;s school fees could not be paid without some element of hardship on their children. Whilst grandparents may be happy to set up direct payments to the schools during their lifetime consideration should also be given to how payments can continue to be made in the event of their death.</p>\n<p>Our advice to grandparents will always focus initially on their own future financial needs. With the death of a spouse the household income may reduce &ndash; particularly if payments from an occupational scheme reduce by 50% to the surviving spouse. However in the event of the death of both grandparents then consideration may be given to making a further lump sum payment into the trust for their grandchildren rather than leaving all of the assets to their children (the parents).</p>\n<p>So as the new school term gets underway it is perhaps time for grandparents to do their own homework and make an appointment with a solicitor.</p>\n<p>Sarah Nadin is a specialist trust solicitor and member of STEP.

In the UK, data protection laws only apply to living people, so practice varies from company to company and there is no uniform approach. The copyright in your e-mails and photos would legally pass to your executors but what good is that if they don&rsquo;t have the passwords to access them?</p>\n<p>To help, Banner Jones Solicitors&rsquo; have written some top tips to help you manage your digital legacy. Your priority is to write a Will and make sure you include your digital assets in your Will. If you don&rsquo;t and there is a conflict between your Will and other arrangements, your Will will always take precedence. Then, create a list of your online accounts, memberships, passwords etc and decide which account is to pass to whom. Specify on that list if any of your accounts are to be deleted after your death.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve seen examples of deceased&rsquo;s Facebook accounts being left open giving their friends and relatives the opportunity to leave memorial messages, but if you don&rsquo;t want this to happen then you will need to specify that your account be closed in your Will. Nominate a &ldquo;digital executor&rdquo; in your Will to handle the transfer of your accounts after your death. This doesn&rsquo;t have to be the same person as the one who deals with your &ldquo;real&rdquo; assets. Your digital executor would then have the right to access your accounts.&nbsp; Anyone who isn&rsquo;t a digital executor could be on shaky ground legally speaking if they try to access your accounts without the right to do so. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another thing to think about and include in your Will are the details of any online billing sites that you use i.e. for mobile phones and online services.&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be difficult to establish the liabilities on death and cancel the services if the executors do not know who the deceased bought services from. The estate may end up with unnecessary bills if the accounts/services aren&rsquo;t terminated and not all organisations will agree to cancel charges from the date of death. These bills will come off the total estate so it&rsquo;s better to get these sorted as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Planning for the future in such a way is never something high on most people&rsquo;s priorities but perhaps it should be and more importantly perhaps this is something you want to point out to your parents. Silver surfers are becoming increasingly active and many will have a mix of both traditional and on line accounts, so it might be worth making sure they have not only written a Will but within the Will have detailed all of their digital assets so that they are not lost forever.</p>','2010-11-30',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','2010-12-17 11:17:11','2010-12-17 16:40:18',1,1,0,NULL,1,0,'admin'),(16,'Facebook Fuels Divorce','Gone are the days of having to hire a private investigator to prove a cheating spouse, evidence of a partner’s infidelity could now be found literally at your fingertips.

Chief Executive Peter Bolton King predicted the rise of ‘postcode power’ as premium areas emerge from the slump at a faster rate than others.\r\nAny recovery, he warned, will be strongly dependent on the major lenders making mortgage finance more available. Bank of England decisions on interest rates will also have a major effect on the market. The monthly wait for the MPC’s decision on interest rates will be a nervous time for both existing and potential borrowers.\r\nHowever, Mr Bolton King said that, while the housing market faces a tough year, he was confident that no widespread drop in house prices would occur.\r\nHe said: “The housing market remains in a state of fragile recovery as the year ends. Frankly, however, this recovery is threatened by the stubborn refusal of major lenders to loosen their self-serving restrictions on mortgage lending.”\r\n“A historically low rate of interest has benefited those people who already have a mortgage, but it is likely that over the next 12 months it will rise. That will place more pressure on existing borrowers but also remove mortgages from the reach of even those house buyers with large deposits.”\r\n“The danger is that a backlog of pent-up demand for property emerges.

Consumer confidence has fallen recently, partly as a result of nervousness about the economic outlook.</p>\r\n<p>There have been further signs that the recent downward trend in prices is causing homeowners to be more reluctant to put their properties on the market.&nbsp; This development should help to relieve downward pressures on prices as long as it is sustained.&nbsp; Despite pressure on the MPC as a result of inflation, interest rates need to remain very low for some time, supporting a favourable affordability position for many existing mortgage borrowers and those entering the market.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Younger Britons Want To Escape Rental Sector</strong></p>\r\n<p>Young adults are more attached to the idea of owning their own home than any other age-group, with 86% of under-30s identifying it as a key priority in life, according to a major survey from the Barratt HomeBuyers&rsquo; Panel. However, young people are often unable to take their first step on the property ladder and the average age of an unassisted first-time buyer is now 37.

If you can’t pay your debts as they fall due there is something you can do about it. Since 1986 the law has allowed many businesses to leave their debts behind them and start again. This can be an unpopular move when a business is seen to ‘go bust’ and then on the same day start up again with the same people, same premises and often the same name. ','<p>This is a perfectly legitimate thing to do if done properly and it is commonly referred to as a &lsquo;Pre-Pack&rsquo;. This is because a deal is agreed before the business is placed into Administration or Liquidation. The business is sold to the new company and the debts are left behind as a liability of the old company. Usually an arrangement can be reached to keep the business in the same premises.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Whilst it may an unpopular move for some, you have to remember that if a business closes down people usually lose their jobs and their livelihoods. If the business is therefore kept going the jobs can be saved and this is the main reason why the courts will work to save a business.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If your business is struggling, the sooner you get advice the better. If you have to react to outside pressure, especially to pay bills, then you will invariably be unable to put together the best deal possible. If you realise that in the near future your business will be unable to pay its debts then you still have time to plan your strategy. You also need to be aware that if you pay certain debts in preference to others or sell assets for less than their value you may have to repay the money yourself and we can advise you on this.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To get it right you need to consult a solicitor who will also involve a Licenced Insolvency Practitioner.

Research by unbiased.co.uk, a website that allows you to search for mortgage brokers and financial advisers, indicates that nearly 50 per cent of borrowers have not reviewed their mortgages since the base rate dropped to its record low. It says that many borrowers have been lulled into a false sense of security by their lower monthly costs.</p>\r\n<p>Separate research by MarketGuard, the specialist insurer, suggests that nearly three million borrowers would struggle to afford their mortgages if interest rates increased by only 1 per cent. This number rises to nearly five million people if rates rise by 2 per cent. Borrowers often leave it too late to switch to a fixed rate, waiting until after the base rate starts to rise and all the best deals have disappeared.</p>\r\n<p>The rates that lenders pay to fund fixed-rate deals have been on an upward trend since October, despite a dip at the end of last month after disappointing GDP figures. During recent weeks a number of lenders have increased the price of fixed-rate deals and many more are expected to follow suit as demand grows. ING Direct and Northern Rock both increased rates by up to 0.4 percentage points on some of their fixed deals last week. First Direct increased the price of some fixed and tracker mortgages by up to 0.3 points, as well as increasing fees on certain products by up to &pound;500.</p>\r\n<p>Opinions are divided over when base rate is likely to rise. Andrew Sentance, a member of the Bank of England&rsquo;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, has been voting for a rate rise for many months. Last month he was joined by a second member of the nine-strong committee in calling for an increase.</p>\r\n<p>The Council of Mortgage Lenders says that it is &ldquo;quite possible&rdquo; that rates will stay at 0.5 per cent for the rest of this year. Others believe that the MPC will cave in to market pressure to raise rates much sooner and says that there could be a quarter-point rise as early as next month. He expects the base rate to end the year at 2 per cent and to reach about 3.5 per cent within five years.</p>\r\n<p>Mortgage brokers say that trying to guess when the base rate will rise is a bad strategy because it is impossible to predict. If you are on a variable rate, however, it is crucial to check that you would still be able to afford your mortgage if rates increase.</p>\r\n<p>Many borrowers who have seen their loan-to-value ratio increase because their property has fallen in value relative to the size of the home loan, or who no longer meet lenders&rsquo; criteria, could be forced to stay on the lender&rsquo;s SVR because they do not qualify for new, cheaper, deals.</p>\r\n<p>Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, the housing charity, says: &ldquo;So far, low interest rates have been crucial in helping struggling homeowners to stave off repossession and keep a roof over their head.&rdquo; Mr Robb warns that even a small rise in interest rates could push many borrowers over the edge. (The charity has a free helpline for homeowners on 0300 3300515).</p>\r\n<p>Second-guessing what will happen with interest rates is a tricky game to play and borrowers are best to consider how well they are equipped to deal with rate increases.</p>\r\n<p>Looking at how monthly payments will be affected by rate rises will help borrowers to decide how much they value the protection afforded by a fixed rate and I expect a growing number to choose this option.</p>\r\n<p>Other borrowers who are prepared to accept the risk of interest rate volatility, and who believe that increases are likely to be gradual, may stick with tracker deals.</p>\r\n<p>Good advice is to try to overpay while interest rates remain low, to help to soften the payment shock when rates begin to rise. Some lenders will allow borrowers to reserve fixed-rate deals up to six months in advance.</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately there is no right or wrong; fix for comfort, track to speculate and accumulate.</p>','2011-02-10','CHRIS SELLARS2.jpg','image/pjpeg',188017,'2011-02-21 16:13:53','','2011-02-21 16:13:57','2011-02-21 16:13:57',2,NULL,0,NULL,1,0,'admin'),(22,'I’m a sole trader, should I consider incorporating to a Limited Company?','Quite often businesses start up as either sole traders or partnerships but at some stage many of those will become a limited company.

This means that providing the rules are followed individuals will not take on personal liability for contracts and creditors. It is common for banks, landlords and finance companies to still require personal guarantees whilst the newly formed Ltd Company establishes a credit history, however, these personal guarantees should be limited to an agreed sum.

However, experts have warned that only 10,000 first-timers are likely to be helped by the scheme, which will run for just a year. It will also be restricted to new-build properties. \r\n','<p>It is the latest in a string of proposals put forward by housebuilders, banks and local authorities, as well as the government to break the property deadlock.

This is the first optimistic prediction for many months, after a slew of downbeat figures have suggested the housing market is moribund. \r\nEarlier this month, the Halifax said that the average cost of a home dropped 1.4pc during April to the lowest level since July 2009. The lender also suggested that 64 per cent of young people who did not own their own home had completely given up on the dream of being an owner occupier, as restrictive mortgage conditions meant it was impossible to get on the housing ladder. \r\n','<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has also said that until mortgage lenders started to relax their conditions, and consumer confidence picked up, they could see no sign up house prices returning to growth.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Over the weekend, the property research group Hometrack said house prices in England and Wales fell by 0.1 per cent in May following a drop in the number of house-hunters registering with estate agents.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, the CEBR has said that &ndash; despite property values continuing to fall for much of 2011, ending the year around 1.4 per cent lower than they started it &ndash; the market will begin to stabilise towards the end of the year, when the UK\'s property shortage will once again underpin prices.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Improvements to the major banks\' balance sheets should lead to them loosening their strict lending criteria, enabling more people to buy a home.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The severe shortage of new homes, caused by the financial pressures faced by house builders and a lack of demand, will eventually lead to an economic readjustment. The CEBR said with just 130,000 new homes built in 2010, around half the level needed to keep pace with the growing number of households, prices should increase by 16 per cent between 2011 and 2015, the equivalent of a gain of around 4 per cent a year.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This level of growth would see the market return to a more healthy level after the boom and bust of recent years, when prices raced up at 9 per cent a year on average from in 2007 and 2008, before crashing 10.5 per cent in 2009.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Douglas McWilliams, the CEBR\'s chief executive said: \"We think the market is currently close to the bottom for the UK as a whole. The main factor driving house prices up is the shortage of available housing which has already pushed up rents.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Housing completions fell to only 130,000 in 2010, well below the level required to keep pace with demographic change.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Other property experts are not convinced by CEBR\'s optimism. There is certainly a huge amount of pent up demand. But whether that translates into higher house prices depends on whether banks and building societies respond by lending money to consumers.</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Secret \'95 Pc Mortgage\' Proposals \'Will Help Young First Home Buyers\'</h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Secret talks have reportedly been held between senior executives from several FTSE-listed companies, leading banks and the Council of Mortgage Lenders in an attempt to ease the supply of finance.

Official figures show that as much as £205 million was accessed via equity release schemes in the UK in 2010. But is it really right for you? \r\n\r\nThere are two types of equity release deal: lifetime mortgages and home reversion schemes. They are available only to older homeowners. Some schemes have a minimum age as low as 50; for others, the age limit is 70. \r\n\r\nLifetime loans, otherwise known as roll-up mortgages, are a type of home loan on up to 50 per cent of a property’s value, so you must pay interest on how much you borrow. The younger you are, the higher the rate of interest. However, repayments can be rolled up and are paid in full when the property is sold or when the borrower dies or goes into long-term care. \r\n\r\nReversion schemes, for homeowners above the age of 65, involve selling all or part of your home to an equity release company, then living in it rent-free until you die, or until you go into long-term care. At this point, the company sells the property and takes its cut from the sale proceeds, which will include any growth. \r\nAsk yourself the eight questions below when you try to determine whether or not equity release really is right for you. \r\n','1. Do you want to reduce the value of the estate you leave behind to your family? \r\nThis is an important question to ask yourself and it is always worth remembering that any equity release scheme will reduce the value of the inheritance you leave for your family. \r\n\r\n2. Do you want to involve your family in your decision? \r\nAs question one highlights, equity release will have an impact on how much money you leave behind when you are gone. It may be wise to involve your family in your decision in order to avoid any disputes when you are gone. \r\n\r\n3. Will it affect your benefits? \r\nEquity release schemes can affect your ability to claim state benefits. You should think about this before you consider committing to a scheme. Speaking to a lawyer can help determine how equity release may affect your entitlement. \r\n\r\n4. Will you want to pay the equity release loan back early? \r\nReleasing cash from your home is a lifetime commitment – most equity release loans are only expected to be repaid when you die or if you go into long term care. If you want to repay the loan earlier you may have to pay additional costs. \r\n\r\n5. Can you borrow money in another way? \r\nYou may need cash, but you may not need an equity release scheme in order to access it. Ask yourself if you could get money via a standard loan or mortgage before considering the equity release route. \r\n\r\n6. Should you just downsize? \r\nHome is where the heart is and many people do not want to move when they no longer need to live in such a large property, no matter how big their home is. Before undertaking an equity release scheme ask yourself if you’d prefer to simply sell up your property and move somewhere smaller. \r\n\r\n7. Should you take professional advice? \r\nEquity release schemes should not be entered into light-heartedly and they can affect your benefit payments, as well as your inheritance and estate planning options. Consulting a lawyer before moving forward with a scheme could be useful. \r\n\r\n8. Will you want to move house? \r\nYou can move home under equity release schemes, but the process is obviously slightly more complicated, as you will need to move the equity release loan to the new property. The new property will also have to meet certain criteria to enable you to move the loan. \r\nWith property prices having increased considerably over the last two decades, it is no surprise that people are increasingly relying on their house to help fund their retirement. Releasing equity from your home could be a great way to fulfil your retirement dreams. \r\nReleasing equity from homes is a trend that is likely to continue for many years to come, but make sure that the scheme you choose is right for you and your own specific needs before committing to a plan. \r\n','2011-07-15','69_iStock_000003465599XSmall.jpg','image/jpeg',245782,'2011-07-15 11:17:29','','2011-07-15 11:17:30','2011-07-15 11:17:30',2,NULL,0,NULL,1,0,'admin'),(37,'Will Writers \'Rip off thousands every year\'','guardian.co.uk, Monday 18 July 2011\r\n\r\nLegal ombudsman calls on government to take action over unregulated companies offering consumer financial services.\r\n\r\nWhich? says there is a lack of clarity over financial services including will writing. \r\nThousands of people are being ripped off by unregulated claims management and will writing companies, the legal ombudsman has said in his first annual report.\r\n','<p>Chief ombudsman Adam Sampson called on the government to take urgent action to make sure consumers are not left confused and vulnerable by unregulated companies.</p>\r\n<p>The consumer organisation <a title=\"Which? website\" href=\"http://www.which.co.uk/\">Which?</a> and the <a title=\"Law Society website\" href=\"http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/home.law\">Law Society</a> backed the claims and called for more protection for customers.</p>\r\n<p>They said the increased bundling of legal services with financial services and other products, including more being offered via the internet, posed serious dangers for consumer protection.</p>\r\n<p>The ombudsman said that since becoming operational late last year his office had been contacted by 38,155 people and had accepted 3,768 cases for investigation.

Where there is no recognised independent trade union representation, nor existing employee representatives authorised to act on the employees’ behalf, representatives must be elected by the affected employees. Where the employer fails to comply with these provisions, the Employment Tribunal (ET) can require the payment of a protective award.','In Phillips v Xtera Communications Ltd., the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) held that in situations where the number of employee nominees or candidates matches the number of representatives to be elected, it is not necessary for the employer to conduct a formal ballot in order to satisfy the statutory requirements regarding the election of employee representatives.<br />&nbsp;<br />Mr Phillips worked for Xtera Communications Ltd. at its Harold Wood site. In May 2008, the company was considering closing the site as part of a programme of substantial cuts. Members of staff were notified by email that more than 20 jobs could be lost and that a formal process of consultation would be undertaken. It was suggested that two employee representatives would be sufficient to negotiate with the company and staff were invited to indicate whether they wished to hold an election. If candidates were proposed and an election desired, this would be arranged.<br />&nbsp;<br />The employees held a meeting and agreed on two nominees to act as their representatives. Mr Phillips did not attend the meeting but signified to colleagues that he was in agreement with the decision taken. The company contacted all staff asking if there were any objections to the two people whose names had been put forward being elected and no objections were forthcoming. When one of the original nominees stepped down, a replacement came forward. A third person then volunteered to act as an additional employee representative. The company agreed to this and no objection was made by any employee regarding the revised arrangements.<br />&nbsp;<br />In the event, the Harold Wood site was kept open with a reduced workforce. Following a redundancy selection process, Mr Phillips and one other staff member were made redundant.<br />&nbsp;<br />Mr Phillips made various claims to the ET, including a claim for a protective award. He contended that the employee representatives were not elected in accordance with TULRCA because Xtera Communications had failed to comply with its obligation to arrange an election process. The ET rejected this claim.<br />&nbsp;<br />On appeal, the EAT held that Section 188A of TULRCA does not expressly require that a ballot be conducted or a vote be undertaken in every circumstance. Where the number of nominees is the same as the number of representatives sought, an election would merely involve the employer expending valuable time and resources on a wholly unnecessary exercise.<br />&nbsp;<br />Although the employees in this case were not given the opportunity anonymously to object to the candidates, it was open to anyone who dissented to put their own name forward or to nominate another candidate. Also, any staff member could have requested that a formal election be held. No such responses were made.<br />&nbsp;<br />Furthermore, the ultimate safeguard against manipulation of the democratic process is the duty on the employer, under TULRCA 188A(1)(a), to ensure that the election of employee representatives is fair.<br />&nbsp;<br />The appeal was therefore dismissed.<br /><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />If you are contemplating making staff redundant, we can advise you to ensure that the appropriate arrangements are put in place','2011-10-05','55_iStock_000001814995XSmall.jpg','image/jpeg',132191,'2011-10-05 08:33:39','','2011-10-05 08:33:39','2011-10-05 08:34:55',2,2,0,NULL,1,0,'admin'),(40,'Companies Fined After Death From Fall at Work','Two companies have been fined a total of £450,000 and ordered to pay costs after health and safety failures led to a maintenance worker falling to his death.\r\n\r\nChristopher Booker, 49, was working at Aberthaw Power Station when the accident happened in 2007.

It was then entered and checked. The publisher spent around &pound;82,000 per year on the research and around &pound;30,000 entering and checking the data. The court found that the publisher had made a significant financial and human investment in the surviving records, whether 6,000 or 4,783.</p>\n<p>Quantitatively, it also decided that both 6,000 (14 per cent) and 4,783 (11 per cent) records amounted to a substantial part of the database (although at the low end of substantial), but decided this partly because of the time and effort required to create each record and keep it up to date.</p>\n<p>The court therefore seemed to be saying that the more investment has been made in building a database, the lower the proportion of it that needs to be extracted or reused in order to infringe the owner’s database rights, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>It also said that, if insubstantial parts of a database had been repeatedly and systematically extracted for the purposes of a mailing, but they could be recombined to rebuild a substantial part of the database, then that could amount to extraction of a substantial part.

It owns copyrights in the broadcasts of live Premier League matches which it makes available via satellite, selling exclusive licences to broadcasters in each EU country giving them the sole right to broadcast those matches to their subscribers in that country. </p>\n<p>To protect its copyrights, the FAPL requires each broadcaster to encrypt the satellite signal provided to the subscribers, which means subscribers in each country need a decoder device to see the matches. Crucially, the licences stop each broadcaster from providing its decoders outside its territory. In the UK, there is also a law that stops people in the UK from using foreign decoders &ndash; aimed at stopping them from accessing satellite broadcasts from another EU country.</p>\n<p>A pub landlady from Portsmouth used a Greek decoder and showed Greek broadcasts of the matches to her customers. This was cheaper than using a UK decoder. The UK High Court asked the ECJ to rule on 18 different issues arising from the dispute, to help it make its own decision. Among its ruling, the ECJ said:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>foreign decoders were not an illegal ‘illicit device’, even if obtained using a false name and address and even if supplied in breach of the licence terms, since ultimately the FAPL was still being paid for their use;</li>\n<li>the clauses in the FAPL licences stopping broadcasters from one EU country from selling their decoders to people in another EU country were against EU competition law;</li>\n<li>the UK law stopping people importing, selling or using foreign decoders was against EU law on the freedom to provide services throughout the EU, for which there was no ‘objective justification’.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, the ECJ also said that people were not allowed to screen broadcasts containing certain copyright materials (known as ‘protected works’) belonging to the FAPL without permission. These do not include on-pitch action, but do include, for example, Premier League logos, music and pre-recorded highlights. The live matches the pub landlady was accessing using the Greek decoder did contain protected works, and she did not have the FAPL’s permission to show them.</p>\n<p>In making this ruling, the ECJ clearly took into account that the landlady was screening the matches for profit.</p>\n<p>The ECJ has now remitted the dispute back to the High Court to rule on the case.</p>\n<p><b>Recommendation</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pubs and other venues showing Premier League football matches for profit should not rush to buy foreign decoders until the High Court has issued its ruling – particularly on the issue of whether they can show broadcasts that include FAPL copyright materials without prior FAPL permission.</li>\n<li>Those wishing to access matches for their own use using foreign decoders should take specialist legal advice.</li>\n</ul>','2011-10-28',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-01-18 12:53:57','2012-01-18 12:53:57',NULL,NULL,0,NULL,1,0,'http://feeds.bhpinfosolutions.co.uk/category/Legal-News/feed/'),(75,'Charity Commission publishes update to Equality Act guidance','The Charity Commission has published an update to its guidance on the application of the Equality Act exception, for charities whose objects would otherwise be discriminatory under the Act.','<p><b>The Charity Commission has published an update to its guidance on the application of the Equality Act exception, for charities whose objects would otherwise be discriminatory under the Act.</b></p>\n<p>The Act contain a special exception for charities, which means they can have objects in their constitutions that limit their services to particular groups of beneficiaries even if that means they are discriminating against others (for example, on grounds of their race, sex, race, disability, sexual orientation or age – characteristics usually protected by the Act).</p>\n<p>The Charity Commission published guidance on the exception in September 2010, but this left areas unclear.

For example, a charity may be able to show it is compensating for a perceived disadvantage if it is set up to help the unemployed of a particular nationality or ethnicity, but only if unemployment is particularly high among these groups compared to unemployment for other groups.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The guidance makes clear that the limit must actually be in the charity’s constitution if it is to rely on either test.

She claimed unfair dismissal.</p>\n<p>The Employment Tribunal (ET) ruled that she had resigned. It said that the statement that her employment was to be terminated from 31 December was an error and the employer had withdrawn it as soon as it realised.

The GPhC&nbsp; believes that in ensuring all pharmacies attain the relevant standards it is vital that those considered to operate where there is a &ldquo;higher risk&rdquo; to patients or the public owing to the services they provide or other issues, inspections should be prioritised more frequently.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Consultation document identifies five key principles that premises are expected to meet including ensuring that the premises and all equipment and facilities are safe and suitable.

In September 1996 an application was made to the hospital&rsquo;s ethics committee for approval of a research project in which Professor Walker-Smith was named as one of the responsible consultants . The research was to focus upon proving the possible link between the measles/rubella vaccine in a previously healthy child and subsequent development of entiritis, Cbl deficiency and disintegrative disorder. The project was given conditional approval in January 1997.</p>\r\n<p>Between July 1996 and February 1997 eleven children were admitted to the hospital for investigation. The case histories of those children together with an additional 12<sup>th</sup> child were subsequently published in the Lancet. At a press conference one of the supervising consultants stated that he could no longer support the giving of the MMR vaccine.</p>\r\n<p>This statement and the subsequent attendant publicity had an adverse effect on the take-up of the vaccine which caused great concern by those responsible for public health.</p>\r\n<p>In October 2004 charges of serious professional conduct were brought against Mr Walker-Smith and two other supervising consultants involved in the research and the case was brought before a fitness to practise panel. The allegations were that in respect of the eleven children they had subjected them to a programme of investigation for research purposes without ethics committee approval either because the investigations occurred prior to approval being given or because their condition did not meet the specific criteria or had been carried out in breach of the conditions approved by the committee. Further that some investigations had been clinically inappropriate.</p>\r\n<p>The appellant doctor&rsquo;s case was that he had been conducting medical practice which did not in fact require ethics committee approval. The fundamental question that fell to be determined by the fitness to practice panel was whether or not the conduct had been medical practice or research and to ascertain what the appellant&rsquo;s intention had been.</p>\r\n<p>In May 2010 the Committee decided that the appellant and the two other supervising consultants were guilty of serious professional misconduct and their names&nbsp; were ordered to be erased from the medical register.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Walker-Smith appealed.</p>\r\n<p>Held- in allowing the appeal- the panel&rsquo;s conclusion both in respect of the questions to be determined on general issues and in relation to individual children subject to the research investigations, had been flawed in deciding that he had been guilty of serious professional misconduct. The first matter was to decide what the appellant himself had thought he had been doing. If he had believed that he was undertaking research in the guise of clinical investigation and treatment then he deserved the finding of misconduct. If not, then unless his actions fell outside the spectrum of reasonable medical practice what he was doing was perfectly acceptable.</p>\r\n<p>The Panel had failed to address this fundamental question and it went to the root of the overall determination.

Instead of simply notifying a change of address or other detail it contains allegations raising a question mark over your fitness to practice. Overnight, literally many can find themselves wondering if they will remain in their chosen career and worse still whether they will escape the risk of their reputation and livelihood being destroyed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Generally statistics from the across the regulatory spectrum show an increase per year certainly in the number of complaints which justify referral to a caseworker in the Fitness to practise arena. As the complaint culture prevails in society generally, it is also exacerbated by the sweeping economic changes and cutbacks in the NHS which places an additional strain on the workforce and healthcare resources so as to increase the chances of something going wrong somewhere . Although it is true to say that the number of practitioners that find themselves under investigation is still relatively small overall compared with the total number of registrants, the number of cases reaching the Conduct and Competence Committee has been steadily on the rise. The number of those who go through these proceedings without representation is also striking.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The following are some key steps to take and a general guide should the unthinkable happen to you.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">1.&nbsp; Do not ignore the letter- the easiest thing is to believe that it will go away if you bury your head in the sand and that it is something that will resolve without your cooperation and input.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">2.&nbsp; It can often be the case that the letter comes at the end of an already painful chapter one in which you have already gone through a Trust or hospital disciplinary investigation affecting your employment. The fact is the same circumstances and evidence can and often are the subject of several sets of investigations and proceedings. If you have been dismissed or have undergone disciplinary proceedings make sure you have a copy of the papers including the meeting notes and correspondence .</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">3.&nbsp; Legal advice, assistance, and representation from the outset can significantly reduce the chances of an investigation proceeding all the way to a full Fitness to Practise hearing and certainly to limit the chances of the imposition of a more serious sanction if it does .</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">4.&nbsp; Time limits are fairly stringent so don&rsquo;t delay. It can sometimes be possible to obtain an extension in which submissions are to be received and put before&nbsp; the Investigation Committee.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">5.&nbsp; &nbsp;Contact your local RCN representative and find out what help may be available to you and remember that you also have the right to a freedom of choice of your own solicitor . This is a specialist area and you need the appropriate expertise on your side.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">6.&nbsp; Avoid the shame game. So many find that they are so overwhelmed by the fear and anxiety of losing their registration that they don&rsquo;t want to read the papers especially where the circumstances leading to an investigation were distressing or the consequences significant. Having someone hear your side of the story and put forward your explanation can be a real weight off your mind.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">7.&nbsp; Getting the advice and help in relation to the procedures and the next steps enables you to understand better the process so that you can engage in it and commence a dialogue with the NMC. Even if you instruct a solicitor privately it needn&rsquo;t cost the earth.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">8.&nbsp; A lawyer can also provide you with an objective assessment of the merits of your case and the evidence including any documentation you may need to secure to use in your defence.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">9.&nbsp; The key to defending these proceedings is being able to understand what is alleged and to receive objective advice in respect of your conduct. Being able to demonstrate insight where you may have departed from good practice is essential. Drafting robust submissions is critical right from the outset so that when the matter is referred to the investigation Committee they can consider your arguments as well.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">10.&nbsp; If your case does proceed to a Conduct and Competence Committee your solicitor can advise you as to how best to prepare for that, organise representation and advise you as to the potential outcomes and costs. He or she can advise you as to the appropriate remediation you can make or the references and workplace reports to be gathered on your behalf that are critical in defending these cases.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Remember these can and often do have happy endings and there are often ways of avoiding the most draconian outcomes including agreeing a regime of conditions in appropriate cases or satisfying the Investigation Committee that there is no case to answer.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is rare that a professional can complete their career without receiving a complaint from someone whether it is a patient, service user or their relative or representative.

He had been said to have acted in various ways which were not in her best interests and in abuse of his professional position. The most serious of the allegations concerned the fact that he had attempted to pursue an emotional relationship, had revealed his sexual fantasies about her, spoke of meeting socially, told her how attractive he found her and told her personal information about himself. &nbsp;All of &nbsp;this was said to have been sexually motivated.</p>\r\n<p>The GMC at the Fitness to Practise hearing applied to adduce the evidence of the Patient&rsquo;s testimony by means of a live video link from Australia where she was living at the time of the hearing and this was successful despite contest by the doctor.</p>\r\n<p>During the course of the evidence, it was agreed between the parties that the Patient suffered from erotic transference which meant that at some time during her therapy she had developed sexual and erotic feelings towards the doctor which were not based on genuine feelings about his qualities but involved the projection on to him by the patient of internal feelings. Over the course of the proceedings, the FTPP made a series of adverse findings against the doctor and in particular that &ldquo; from its own experience the (FTPP) reasoned that a woman with low self-esteem unless encouraged would be unlikely to fantasise that she was attractive to another and secondly the Panel considered what impact erotic transference might have had on the Patient&rsquo;s perception of events which according to expert evidence, could have been from the Patient&rsquo;s &nbsp;previous experience&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>The Panel determined that the doctor&rsquo;s fitness to practise was impaired and ordered that his name be erased from the GMC register.</p>\r\n<p>The doctor appealed on the basis firstly that the witness could not and should not have been categorised as a vulnerable witness by reason of a mental disorder when her depression was in fact in remission at the time and that the Panel had erred in concluding that it could admit the evidence of the patient by video link under its inherent jurisdiction to admit evidence where there was a clear statutory framework governing the same. He also argued that the Panel should not have relied upon its own expertise as regards the finding in respect of the Patient&rsquo;s self esteem and it had reached a conclusion on an issue which had not been raised by either of the parties at the hearing and the doctor had been deprived of the opportunity of calling evidence upon that or making submissions. He further argued that in respect of the finding as regards the Patient&rsquo;s perception of events he argued that the Panel&rsquo;s decision as against the weight of the expert evidence. In short the Panel had erred in one or both of these findings such that it affected and tainted the FTPP&rsquo;s factual findings and they were to be regarded as unsafe.</p>\r\n<p>The appeal court agreed and the case was remitted for a fresh hearing before a new Fitness to Practise panel.</p>\r\n<p>The important aspect of this Judgment is that it reinforced the fundamental principle underlying Fitness to practise proceedings in that a court can only make findings of fact in respect of matters which the parties have been afforded a fair opportunity to adduce evidence or to make submissions as appropriate.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>','2012-03-22',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','2012-03-22 12:11:48','2012-03-22 12:11:48',2,NULL,0,NULL,1,0,'admin'),(128,'Challenging CRB checks','Have you been or are you affected by CRB disclosures and impact on your chosen career?\r\n\r\n','<p>Frequently significant numbers of medical students, doctors,&nbsp; teachers, health professionals, nurses and social workers have experienced the nightmare of historic events or spurious allegations having a draconian effect on their reputation and curtailing their career overnight. They can be affected at the time of application for a job or entry to a profession or as a result of misconduct.</p>\r\n<p>All too common are the stories from students on the brink of graduation or entry to their chosen profession where disclosure on the application for registration reveals something of a &ldquo;blemish&rdquo; which throws into question their fitness and suitability for practice.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Failure to Disclose ?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>The double whammy comes when through fear or ignorance applicants fail to disclose relevant cautions or convictions or other information which is subsequently revealed through the CRB check. The failure to disclose is then treated usually as a distinct matter of dishonest misconduct which in turn can prevent someone from pursuing a professional career.</p>\r\n<p>The process by which the CRB provides criminal record data is called &ldquo;Disclosure&rdquo; of which there are two levels- Standard and Enhanced.&nbsp; The checks are available to organisations and for a number of professions, offices, employments, work and occupations listed in the Exceptions order to the Rehabilitation of offenders Act 1974.</p>\r\n<p>Standard disclosure applications are checked against the Police National Computer and are usually turned around in 10 days.&nbsp; Enhanced disclosure affects those who are involved with greater contact with children and/or vulnerable adults and include:</p>\r\n<p>Doctors, nurses, midwives, teachers, pharmacists, health professionals across a broad spectrum, Judicial appointments and some volunteer positions such as Scout or Guide Leaders, Youth workers etc all require Enhanced Disclosure.</p>\r\n<p>The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Enhanced Disclosure</span> involves an additional request for information from the police as to any other information held on their files that may be relevant and principally this could be investigations that have not led to formal criminal prosecutions and a criminal conviction/ caution resulting in a criminal record as such. These are usually turned around within 28 days.&nbsp; Both types of checks involve a search of the Registers held containing lists of those who have been barred from working with children or vulnerable adults. No one would disagree that those who have committed serious offences and in particular offences of violence or sexual assault are to be prevented from having access to or working with children or vulnerable adults.</p>\r\n<p>Equally many professional bodies for example the GMC and NMC have clear guidance in respect of the treatment of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">minor offences</span> and particularly historic matters and the extent to which further additional information is to be sought in such cases. Many can, subject to the satisfaction of fitness to practise criteria and by providing detailed accounts in respect of the incidents in question, be able to continue if minor offences are disclosed.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Relevant information ?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Problems often arise in the context of the disclosure of additional relevant information by police, in the context of an Enhanced Disclosure Application. The extent to which data is deemed relevant is a matter for the officer considering the application and the type of information can be very broadly defined. In exercising judgment there can be situations where the information goes well beyond what most would consider fair and relevant. Many websites can be found in which stories are told of the experiences of incidences of neighbour disputes etc which occurred a significant time ago being brought to light and where the facts are entirely disputed.Or of campaigns to impugn someone&rsquo;s reputation whereby false and malicious allegations are made, eg against teachers.</p>\r\n<p>The aggravating feature is that where a matter has not been the subject of a formal criminal prosecution the allegations are merely that- untested through the rigours of a criminal trial. The fact is the information can fall short of an actual prosecution or arrest, conviction or caution. It can be any information which has come into the hands of the police by any means and can include an investigation which resulted in an acquittal or details of behaviour which is not criminal at all. The policy behind the legislation in terms of the protection of children and vulnerable people is that even if the information &ldquo;might&rdquo; be true it is better to disclose than not.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>&nbsp;Inaccurate information ?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>What if the information revealed is inaccurate or incorrect or relates to someone else?! There are even those who have been the victim of identity fraud and convictions become registered against their name.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Disputing the Record</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Many fail to appreciate the opportunities availed them of challenging the disclosures where the facts of a matter are in dispute or where they can make representations as to the relevance or impact. Putting your side of the story can be critical and especially where otherwise the only information relied upon by the police can be untested hearsay and sometimes inaccurate and misleading statements by those intent on destroying reputations and in due course possibly even livelihoods.</p>\r\n<p>The reality is that you are not able to challenge the information within the disclosure before it is made. Once it has been disclosed you are able to open a dispute with the CRB but it can be a painful and drawn out process. Legal assistance in this regard can be key.</p>\r\n<p>Many do not realise that at the time of an incident records in police notebooks can be made and subsequently find their way into the CRB disclosure. It is critical that people make challenges at the relevant time of the investigations and if police are called to deal with an event, make sure you ask to see the police notebook entry or add your representations and account. It is much harder years down the line to challenge the accuracy or content of the notes which are relied upon and form the basis of the additional disclosure.</p>\r\n<p>Alternatively representations can be made with the prospective employer in the event of a blemished record but it is seldom that this last option appears anything other than futile. Most employers are fearful of employing anyone with a criminal record full stop.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Cautions Convictions Reprimands Warnings</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Many are also persuaded by fear of the police and the trauma of attending the police station that they accept a caution or warning without appreciating that this will be subject to mandatory notification procedures for most members of professions and will affect a CRB check. They do not appreciate that the failure to challenge or dispute the facts and the evidence through the process of a criminal prosecution and trial is not something they can seek to do later &ldquo; by the back door&rdquo; so- to-speak and can in itself lead to damage of one&rsquo;s integrity.</p>\r\n<p>If you are investigated by the police for any reason, for example possession of drugs, theft, drink-driving, &nbsp;it is important if you are a regulated professional or a student intending to enter one of the professions that you seek specialist legal help at the earliest opportunity. There are different considerations to be made in different contexts and being consistent and recognising the impact of any of the above in respect of your fitness to practise is critical.</p>\r\n<p>It can be an arduous process mounting a challenge after the event.</p>\r\n<p>If you are affected by CRB records or facing fitness to practise investigations contact</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rachel Buckley for a confidential no obligation discussion.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Visit our website </strong><strong>http://www.bannerjones.co.uk/page/professional-disciplinary-and-regulatory</strong></p>\r\n<p>For more information visit www. <cite>www.homeoffice.gov.uk/agencies-public-bodies/<strong>crb</strong></cite><cite>/</cite>Cache</p>\r\n<p>Please note the above is not a definitive statement of the law or procedure in this particular area and is intended as a general guide only.</p>\r\n<p>Every case is different and you should seek specific legal advice.

Also the financial burden and expense of getting there.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Imagine then, the scenario whereby all of that and even a blinding set of results and academic achievement seems to have been wasted because there is something that could threaten a person&rsquo;s entry to the profession. Something that could call into question a person&rsquo;s fitness or suitability for practise.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Medical students</span> are not alone in this careers can be curtailed for anyone entering a broad spectrum of regulated fields of practice especially the legal and healthcare arena.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It can only take one supposedly innocent&nbsp; night out in celebration of successful results and behaviour to attract the attention of the police for some reason and the next thing you know you have a caution or a warning on your record.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Police Station</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Anyone spending a night in police cells with a fragile memory of the events of the night or day before is so keen to be released that an outcome such as a caution seems attractive. Many do not appreciate that this involves making admissions as to the misconduct in question. Many also fail to make the connection between this one out of character incident with the rest of their career and their professional life ahead. The notification procedures also mean that the police will automatically refer the fact and circumstances to the regulatory body such as the General Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, the General Pharmaceutical Council or the Health Professions Council to name but a few. Similar procedures and regulations apply to the individual and many overlook the fact that they too are under a professional duty to inform. One of the most common scenarios we deal with is where clients have failed to disclose and this in itself leads to additional allegations of misconduct. Some do not realise that what on the face of it driving a car without checking that the insurance is valid can have an adverse impact on their character and standing. Honesty probity and integrity are essential tenets of the medical profession and indeed many others.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fitness to Practise</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It is difficult to generalise&nbsp; about the types and nature of cases and how they will fall to be dealt with. The GMC guidance defines when a student&rsquo;s fitness to practise can be called into question &ldquo; when their health or behaviour raises a serious or persistent cause for concern about their ability to continue on a medical course, or to practise as a doctor after graduation. This includes, but not limited to, the possibility that they could put patients or the public at&nbsp; risk and the need to maintain trust in the profession.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The GMC also produce a schedule of the categories of concern and appropriate sanctions. This includes fixed penalty notices as well as convictions and cautions as the police are tending to use more of these in certain circumstances which still amount to serious offences. Even a relatively minor incident will fall to be monitored as if repeated it could suggest a pattern of behaviour which could threaten patient safety if unchecked. Past misdemeanours can come back to haunt such as relatively minor shop thefts as a teenager. If such an offence resulted in a caution even&nbsp; a long time before it will fall to be disclosed or will appear on a CRB check.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Students who fail to attend placements or a significant number of lectures can trigger Fitness to practise procedures if they risk failing to meet the competency standards expected. It could be that there is a health issue behind sustained periods of absence. Leaving these unchecked can be regarded as a lack of awareness of or failing to monitor one&rsquo;s health which is a key duty all medical professionals must fulfil and equally a failure to seek help or treatment can indicate a lack of insight to the potential impact a health condition could have on patient safety.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Another common scenario triggering fitness to practise procedures is discovery of forgery of signatures eg supervisor&rsquo;s&nbsp; assessment or references and dishonesty in this context is taken very seriously.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Remember:</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<li>Disclosure is essential</li>\r\n<li>Keep records and make a note of your recollections of incidents</li>\r\n<li>Communicate calmly and effectively especially if interviewed </li>\r\n<li>Admit where appropriate</li>\r\n<li>Insight and understanding are key</li>\r\n<li>Remediation</li>\r\n<li>The age of the incident and historic events are often treated more leniently especially if there has been no repetition</li>\r\n<li>Failure to disclose a conviction or record can be more serious than the incident itself</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Seek legal help &ndash; it can make the difference in the long run</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We have a team of lawyers who are experienced in these matters including fitness to practise investigations, proceedings and appeals both in the context of Universities and Regulatory bodies such as the GMC and Registration and Licensing .</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You&rsquo;ve worked hard to get here.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Don&rsquo;t fall at the last hurdlel!!</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you think you might be or are affected by or facing fitness to practise investigations contact</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /><strong>Rachel Buckley for a confidential no obligation discussion.</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Visit our website </strong><strong>http://www.bannerjones.co.uk/page/professional-disciplinary-and-regulatory</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For more information visit <strong><em>www.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><cite><strong>www.gmc.co.uk</strong></cite>Cache</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Please note the above is not a definitive statement of the law or procedure in this particular area and is intended as a general guide only.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Every case is different and you should seek specific legal advice.

','<p>Doctors, nurses, medical students and&nbsp; other healthcare professionals are all in contact with personal and sensitive information about patients whether in the course of their work or training. Social media use is widespread, particularly Facebook and Twitter and a growing number of internet forums, blogspots and the like are directed specifically at medical and healthcare professionals. What is also apparent is that the use of the same can produce difficulties and potentially incidences of professional misconduct</p>\r\n<p>An article in the Daily Mail last October highlighted the research undertaken by Big Brother Watch and the investigations revealing a number of cases of serious infringements on patient privacy.</p>\r\n<p>These included nurses gossiping about patients on websites such as Facebook with friends colleagues and family. In one case a medical worker at Nottingham University hospital took a photograph of a patient and circulated it on Facebook and one nurse in Scotland was suspended for doing the same.</p>\r\n<p>Other investigations unearthed that NHS staff have admitted snooping through medical files of family friends and colleagues or the same have been found &nbsp;lying around in public places or are stolen or misplaced.</p>\r\n<p>Other concerns are as outlined in an article recorded in the Psychological Reports journal recently, reporting that women are more likely than men to become addicted to Facebook and the findings also looked into the negative impact of this upon a person&rsquo;s job or studies.</p>\r\n<p>The issue of appropriate use of social media is very much the subject of discussion and indeed consultation by the GMC &nbsp;at the moment. Few would disagree that social media is the communication method of the day &nbsp;and it is unlikely to disappear. Some comments on discussion forums across the various healthcare sectors would tend to suggest that knowledge of guidelines issued by regulatory bodies is poor amongst their fellow co-workers.</p>\r\n<p>Continued misuse or failure to adhere to the appropriate practice is likely to result in more complaints and potentially referrals to the NMC/GMC/HPC.</p>\r\n<p>What are some of the general principles to be remembered?

It was argued on her behalf that although the misconduct was serious, she had made early admissions to the police and the court in respect of her conduct. It had not resulted in any patient harm or relate to her clinical practice as a nurse. She had a thirty year history as a nurse with no previous disciplinary history and she produced a number of testimonials and character references praising her clinical practice as a nurse.</p>\r\n<p>The case illustrates the fact that in instances such as this where there are multiple offences of serious dishonesty, and even where the nurse had completed the Court&rsquo;s Community Order ahead of time, it is difficult for a fitness to practise panel to accept that this can provide suitable rehabilitation. Alternative sanctions were considered by the Committee but were dismissed as inappropriate or unsuitable. The Panel equally did not feel that it is possible to formulate conditions of practice to cover scenarios involving dishonesty.</p>\r\n<p>With specific reference to the Indicative Sanctions guidance and also the NMC Code ( 1 May 2008) it was considered that Ms Mansel had breached the following sections:</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;you must be open and honest, act with integrity and uphold the reputation of your profession.

Her case was heard before the Conduct and Competence Committee where she was not present or represented.</p>\r\n<p>At the relevant time she was employed by the Royal Edinburgh hospital. The allegations of misconduct concerned her failing to observe professional boundaries with a patient in her care between 24/12/09 and 5/1/10. She had sent some 33 text messages containing indecent images and containing messages which were sexually motivated. She had also discussed her medication with the patient, chased them with a water filled syringe, kissed the patient on the lips at a New Year event and went on to share a pizza on another occasion.</p>\r\n<p>The panel considered that she had fallen short of the Code&rsquo;s requirements especially in relation to the guidance on clear sexual boundaries.. She had made no attempt to apologise or discourage the relationship. She had four years practice and should have been aware of the guidance and provisions of the Code. It was also found that the relationship had been noticed by other patients and that this had resulted in some patients behaving in a disinhibited way towards nurse Lee&rsquo;s colleagues thereby putting them at risk. She had ignored the warnings and advice of her managers and colleagues about the dangers of failing to observe boundaries. She had failed to inform her employer about the relationship and she had put her own needs above the therapeutic needs of the patient.</p>\r\n<p>Whilst breaches of the Code do not automatically result in a finding of misconduct, the facts in this case taken together demonstrated that she had failed to attain the standards expected of a registered nurse.</p>\r\n<p>Bearing in mind the fact that the incidents were not isolated and there was no demonstration of steps taken by nurse Lee to remedy the conduct or of insight into her actions, it was considered to be serious misconduct. She had also shown little awareness of the consequences of her actions. Indeed she had attempted to make contact with the patient whilst suspended. This undermined her letter outlining her acceptance that she had fallen short of the standards to be expected. There was therefore a serious risk of repetition of the conduct and there was no doubt that the conduct had brought the profession into disrepute. Her fitness to practise was found to be impaired.</p>\r\n<p>She had self reported the conduct but this is a duty upon all registered nurses in any event. She had made reference to a health condition but not produced ay evidence relating to the same. Whilst crossing boundaries with patients does not always result in the most serious sanction, in this case the conduct was clearly sexually motivated. Her actions were considered to have the potential to cause direct or indirect patient harm. She had spent considerable periods of time with the patient, therefore potentially neglecting other patients.

What is significant is that he ticked the box &ldquo; No&rdquo; in response to the question on the form asking whether or not he had any previous convictions or matters outstanding. He stated that he did not believe he had a conviction at the time.</p>\r\n<p>In February 2010 he received a custodial sentence of 6 months but owing to the length of time taken for the matter to be concluded it was suspended for two years. He was also ordered to undertake 120 hours of unpaid work and made subject to a curfew order for 4 months. Having completed the unpaid work and been signed off for it by his probation officer, the following month he applied for retention. He again declared that he had no convictions.</p>\r\n<p>He did not declare his conviction until the following year. He had commenced his pre-registration optometry year firstly at Boots and then at Specsavers in London.</p>\r\n<p>His application was refused on the basis of the seriousness of the conviction, the length of time that he had taken to provide the information to the GOC. His failure to declare it and his reasons provided were not sufficient to explain his conduct which could be regarded as serious dishonesty and such as to bring the profession into disrepute and could put others at risk.</p>\r\n<p>He appealed that decision. He produced a number of character references in support of his case and argued that he should be able to complete his training.</p>\r\n<p>It was found that the central tenets of the profession require that individuals demonstrate honesty and are trustworthy.</p>\r\n<p>The Panel considered that some of the character testimonials did not indicate that the persons providing them were aware of the registrant&rsquo;s failure to disclose his conviction to the GOC.</p>\r\n<p>They also noted that he had failed to advise the university of his conviction so that he had been able to remain on the course.</p>\r\n<p>The conviction and the two instances of failing to declare were very serious and incapable of remedy.

His actions were regarded as deliberate rather than omissions.</p>\r\n<p>His lack of insight presents a risk to the standards of the profession.

Whilst working previously for a different employer she had taken a blank prescription pad some two years earlier.

As a result she placed them at risk of significant harm.</p>\r\n<p>She had made submissions via her solicitors and acknowledged that her actions were misguided and that it was a stupid and foolish thing to do. The Panel considered that this did not show sufficient insight on her part into the fact that what she did was clinically unsafe.

Dr Scott&rsquo;s response was that he had followed the guidance in Good Medical Practice &nbsp;and the supplementary guidance &nbsp;&ldquo;Personal beliefs and Medical Practice&rdquo;. He also maintained that he did not use all the phrases attributed by the complainant and that any views expressed during the consultation were directly relevant to Patient A&rsquo;s clinical care and he would have brought the discussion to an end if his patient had indicated a wish for the conversation to stop.</p>\r\n<p>Following the initial investigations and submissions to the case examiners, further evidence was provided to the GMC from the National Secular Society on 26/5/11 alleging that Dr Scott had spoken on national media suggesting that his own faith had more to offer than that of patient A.

He had initially sought confirmation from the GMC before embarking on the course that it would be recognised and had received a positive statement to that effect. However the GMC subsequently changed the criteria for a PMQ for the purposes of section 21(B) (2) of the Medical Act 1983 in 2010. The criteria included that at least 50% of the standard course of study had to have been undertaken in the country awarding the qualification ie St Kitts. The applicant had been undertaking pre clinical studies by way of distance learning and only 2 months of study in St Kitts.</p>\r\n<p>It was found that there was no clear and unequivocal representation made to the doctor that his qualification would be recognised for the purposes of registration nor any representation that the criteria would not change in the future or at least in the period during which he was involved in obtaining the PMQ. It was not inappropriate for the GMC to insist on a requirement that any awarding institution had a sufficient degree of control and supervision over the period of study as a whole nor was it unfair for the GMC not to impose transitional provisions for those already involved in a course of study.

INSERT INTO `faqs` VALUES (1,'Why do I need a Will? ','<p>Leaving a Will means you can be sure that everything will be dealt with in the way you would wish following your death. It&rsquo;s a great feeling to know that you won&rsquo;t be leaving your loved ones with a mess to sort out.</p>\r\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t make a Will, the &ldquo;Intestacy Rules&rdquo; will govern how your estate is divided up when you die. They determine which of your relatives receives how much and can lead to some nasty surprises. They don&rsquo;t provide at all for your friends or even for a partner who you may have lived with for years &ndash; they will inherit nothing. Under the Intestacy Rules, your step-children are not counted as your children if you have not formally adopted them and will inherit nothing &ndash; even if their other parents have already died.</p>\r\n<p>When you die, someone will need to deal with the practicalities. If you don&rsquo;t make a Will, you have no control over who this will be and it will usually be a family member.</p>\r\n<p>If you make a Will, you can choose who you would like to deal with things. You may prefer to appoint a professional, such as a solicitor or accountant &ndash; someone who will not be suffering the distress of bereavement.  If you are married and have combined assets of &pound;325,000 or more (for tax year 2009/10), you can also <strong>save up to &pound;130,000 of Inheritance Tax</strong> by having a tax-efficient Will drawn up. That&rsquo;s &pound;130,000 more for your children or your partner to enjoy.</p>','2011-01-18 17:03:23','2011-01-18 17:16:24',1,1,0,NULL,1,1),(2,'Won\'t everything just go to my husband/wife?','<p>Not necessarily. The Intestacy Rules set out a strict order of who will inherit what. If you have children, your spouse may not inherit everything you own, whether or not you are close to your children or how wealthy they are in their own right. Your spouse might not even get the house, depending on how much it is worth.</p>','2011-01-18 17:17:12','2011-01-18 17:18:22',1,1,0,NULL,1,2),(3,'Can I give different people different shares of my estate?','Yes. By making a Will, you can set out exactly who is to get what amount. For example, if one of your children needs money more than another, you can leave them unequal amounts if you wish.','2011-01-18 17:18:15','2011-01-18 17:18:15',1,NULL,0,NULL,1,3),(4,'Can I give money to Charity in my Will?','Yes. The Intestacy Rules don&rsquo;t allow for any gifts to charity out of your estate. By making a Will you can leave a set amount or a percentage of your total estate. It&rsquo;s a great way to say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; for the wonderful work they do &ndash; and it helps to save Inheritance Tax too!','2011-01-18 17:18:43','2011-01-18 17:18:43',1,NULL,0,NULL,1,4),(5,'Who will see my Will?','Your Will is a private document whilst you are alive and becomes a public document after you die and probate is granted. Anyone can then obtain a copy from the Probate Registry for a small fee.

If you don&rsquo;t make a Will, they need to apply for Letters of Administration instead, which is very similar. Unless your assets are all owned jointly with someone else and pass to them automatically, you will need Probate before your estate can be paid out. We can provide detailed advice about this if you need it.','2011-01-18 17:19:36','2011-01-18 17:24:36',1,1,0,NULL,1,7),(8,'I have made a Will with a different firm of solicitors.

If not, we would be happy to update it or to make a new Will. It does not matter who wrote your Will originally.','2011-01-18 17:19:50','2011-01-18 17:20:00',1,1,0,NULL,1,8),(9,'My aunt only has one bank account. Can I deal with this on her behalf?\r\n','<p>If the bank allows, it is possible for your aunt to name you as a third party on her bank account.

We can help your aunt complete the mandate form required to put this in place.</p>','2011-03-01 11:51:47','2011-03-01 11:52:33',2,2,0,NULL,1,0),(10,'My aunt receives state benefits.

What can I do?\r\n','<p>If your mother is not able to make a decision as to who she wishes to look after her affairs herself, and you are willing to take on this role, then we can apply to the Court for Deputyship. This would mean that you would be appointed by the Court to be your mother&rsquo;s Deputy.</p>\r\n<p>We will guide you through the whole process including giving the Court details of your mother&rsquo;s financial situation. As the Court requires we will also notify other members of her family of the application.</p>\r\n<p>Once the Court has all of the information they will consider the application and if they believe that you are suitable to manage your mother&rsquo;s affairs then they will appoint you as her Deputy. You will then be responsible for dealing with all of her finances, under the guidance of the Court.</p>\r\n<p>This means you can pay her bills, provide for her day-to-day needs and take care of any problems that arise. You must keep careful records of everything you do on behalf of your mother and we can help you prepare the annual accounts required by the Court.</p>','2011-03-01 11:55:11','2011-03-01 11:56:03',2,2,0,NULL,1,0),(12,'How soon can I file for Divorce?','In England you can get divorced if your marriage has broken down irretrivably, usually proved by allegations of adultery or unreasonable behaviour, or if there has been 2 years\' of continously living apart.','2011-03-22 15:02:29','2011-03-22 15:52:19',2,2,0,NULL,1,0),(13,'Will we have to go to Court during our divorce?','No, getting a divorce should be an administrative excersise only and there are many options open to you that avoid going to Court.','2011-03-22 15:18:56','2011-03-22 15:20:10',2,2,0,NULL,1,0),(14,'Will I lose touch with my children?','Your aim should be that both parents still play an active part in the raising of the child/children.&nbsp; Usually parents sort this out amongst themselves, although if there are problems mediation can be a good way to resolve this.&nbsp; Going to Court should always be the last resort where children are involved.','2011-03-22 15:23:19','2011-03-22 15:23:19',2,NULL,0,NULL,1,0),(15,'He\'s got to keep a roof over our heads hasn\'t he?','<p>Non-residential parents have to pay maintenance for their children; hopefully the amount can be agreed though negotiation and if not then the CSA will decide.

The longer the agreement is in place prior to a marriage or civil partnership being entered into the better. However, agreements entered into after marriage or Civil Partnership can still have legal effect.&nbsp; In order for an agreement of this nature to be made binding there needs to be independent legal advice for both parties, full and frank financial disclosure and no duress.&nbsp; If a pre-nuptial agreement of this nature is entered into at the church door then it is open to an allegation that one party or the other has been under a level of duress to enter into the agreement.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Are pre or postnuptial agreements binding?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Prenuptial agreements are common place on mainland Europe but the courts in England and Wales have always been reluctant to have their overall discretion as to how assets should be divided upon divorce tied in by an agreement reached between two parties prior to the marriage taking place.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A gradual shift towards recognising the validity of pre and post nuptial agreements was brought to a head by the case of <strong>Radmacher v. Grantino</strong>. This case went to the highest court in the land, The Supreme Court, purely on whether a pre-nuptial agreement entered into by the parties in Germany three months before they married was applicable in law in England and Wales.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Supreme Court decided in October 2010 that it was natural to infer that parties entering into agreements of this sort will intend that legal effect would be given to those agreements. Unless the outcome of the pre-nuptial agreement was unfair to any children of the marriage, in which case the court could still ignore or vary the agreement, the agreement would be upheld by the court.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">How do I found out more?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Please contact any member of the family team who would be able to discuss the options available with you.</p>','2010-11-15 10:35:37','2011-04-14 15:28:15','','',1,2,0,NULL,1,0,'<p>Contacts us today to get your agreement in place</p>','58_iStock_000000753188XSmall.jpg','image/jpeg',144736,'2011-03-04 16:11:24','','family_highlight',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','PartnershipAgreements.jpg','image/jpeg',42618,'2011-01-13 14:49:43','Pre or Postmarital/Partnership Agreements','','','Pre or Postmarital/Partnership Agreements','/web/contact_us','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(54,'Civil Partnerships','civil_partnerships','The facts uncovered',54,0,0,1,'2010-04-29 08:55:42','<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">What are Civil Partnerships?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Civil partnerships are for adult same sex couples who are not in existing registered partnerships or marriage and are not closely related.&nbsp;

This is known as a Dissolution.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">How do I end my Civil Partnership?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bringing the relationship to an end involves the similar process to having a divorce.&nbsp; A petition is filed asking that the partnership should be brought to a conclusion and showing that the partnership has definitely come to an end.&nbsp; The petition will need to be lodged with a County Court that specifically deals with dissolving civil partnerships.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">What basis can the partnership be ended by the Court?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The court will accept similar grounds to prove that the relationship has come to an end as those of divorcing couples.&nbsp; The ground for dissolution is that the relationship has broken down irretrievably shown by the following facts:-</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Either that your civil partner&rsquo;s behaviour has been so unreasonable you can no longer bear to live with him or her;</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">That you or your civil partner have lived apart for at least two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition and your partner agrees to a dissolution;</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">That you and your civil partner have lived apart for at least five years prior to the presentation of the petition and the partner&rsquo;s consent is not required, or;</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;Your civil partner has deserted you.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For a desertion petition you will need to have been apart for two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Can I make financial claims against my civil partner if the partnership is brought to a conclusion?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Civil partners can make claims against each other&rsquo;s finances in the same way that heterosexual married couples can.&nbsp;

Can&rsquo;t I just give some assets away, so I leave less than the Nil Rate Band when I die?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you give away large amounts of money, or valuable assets whilst you are alive, you must survive this gift for 7 years otherwise the Inland Revenue will tax you as if you still owned them when you die. This is the case whether you make the gift to an individual or put it into some types of trust.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you put your money or assets into certain types of trust or give them to a company, however, there is an immediate charge to inheritance tax &ndash; even though you are still alive.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. So, I can&rsquo;t give anything away whilst I am alive unless I survive for 7 years?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are certain gifts you can make which are not subject to this 7 year rule. Everyone has an &ldquo;annual exemption&rdquo; for inheritance tax of &pound;3,000 each every tax year. That means you can give away &pound;3,000 in total every tax year and it immediately falls out of your estate for inheritance tax purposes. If you die within 7 years, that gift will not be brought back into account. If you haven&rsquo;t used your annual exemption one year, you can roll it forward for 1 tax year, so you can give away &pound;6,000 the next year. You can only do this once, however.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All gifts to UK charity, registered housing associations, qualifying political parties, national museums and universities are also exempt form inheritance tax altogether, whether you give to them under your Will or during your lifetime.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If your children or grandchildren get married, you can give them or their new spouse a lump sum of &pound;5,000 or &pound;2,500 respectively, completely free of inheritance tax.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can give any amount to your own spouse free of inheritance tax (provided you are both domiciled in England and Wales) although you should seek legal advice before doing so, as this could affect other tax planning possibilities.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are other gifts which are exempt from inheritance tax &ndash; please telephone or call into one of our offices to arrange an appointment and we will be happy to discuss these further.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. If I do decide to give a large amount to my children now, is there anything I can do to reduce the tax?</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can insure the inheritance tax liability which would arise if you were to die within 7 years of the gift. Please ask for more information and one of our specialist advisers will be delighted to explain how this works and, if you wish, put you in touch with a trusted financial expert to help you choose the right policy for you.</p>','2010-11-15 10:57:46','2012-01-20 12:20:42','','',1,2,0,NULL,1,0,'<p>For more FREE information on Trusts and Inheritance Tax please click here</p>','78_iStock_000006000433XSmall.jpg','image/jpeg',189291,'2011-03-04 16:21:53','','family_highlight',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','InheritanceTax.jpg','image/jpeg',35556,'2011-01-11 11:47:27','Inheritance Tax','','','Inheritance Tax','','http://www.lawdonut.co.uk/law/personal-law/family-trusts-and-inheritance-tax/?s=BAN082',NULL,'family_highlight','','/page/retirement-planning','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,''),(68,'Trusts','trusts','A good way to protect your assets',68,0,0,0,'2010-04-29 08:55:42','<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trusts can be used as a way of protecting your assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;They allow for property and assets to be held by trustees for the benefit of one or more individuals - these can be adult or children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These individuals are known as the beneficiaries.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Commonly trusts are set up for assets to be held for the benefit of children until they reach a certain age.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trusts are&nbsp;taxed independently for income tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax purposes.

If you wish to rely on any property being disregarded it is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">vital</span> that you talk to us first, to make sure that it complies with the rules.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3.&nbsp; Give away an asset</strong><br /><strong>WARNING: </strong>you cannot just give away an asset for these purposes. If you give something away and one of your reasons for doing so is to avoid care fees, the &ldquo;notional capital&rdquo; rules mean that you will be assessed as still owning that asset even after you give it away. You<strong> MUST</strong> see a solicitor before giving any assets away &ndash; however large or small. We can also tell you if there are any unforeseen tax or other implications of giving things away.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We recommend that you come to us as soon as you retire &ndash; or even earlier. We can then discuss giving assets away in the context of a long term plan. We can advise on types of trust available to you or alternatives to giving away the asset.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4.&nbsp; Financial planning</strong><br />We work closely with independent financial advisers who specialise in long term care fees planning. There are many different products available, from bonds to insurance policies, which can help to preserve your assets. We would be happy to introduce you to a financial adviser and arrange a 3-way meeting with you, them and us. That way you know that your panel of experts are all working together in your best interests.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5. Challenging funding decisions</strong><br />If you believe that the Local Authority&rsquo;s decision about the funding of your care is wrong then we can challenge it for you. We can help to ensure that the rules are followed correctly so that you don&rsquo;t pay more than you have to.</p>\r\nCall into one of our offices or telephone and we will be happy to arrange an initial appointment','2010-11-15 10:58:54','2011-11-29 15:33:13','','',1,2,0,NULL,1,0,'<p>We work with Independent Financial Advisors with specialist care planning&nbsp;qualifications.</p>\r\n<p>This ensures you get&nbsp;a complete package of advice.</p>\r\n<p>For a joint meeting call us today</p>','108_iStock_000013859617XSmall.jpg','image/jpeg',98164,'2011-03-04 16:35:40','','family_highlight',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','LongTermCare.jpg','image/jpeg',54456,'2010-12-22 10:09:58','Long-term Care Planning','','','Long-term Care Planning','','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(72,'Residential Care Appeals','residential_care_appeals','Care Fee Appeals',72,0,0,1,'2010-04-29 08:55:42','<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">You could be paying too much</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Did you know that if you or a relative need NURSING care, as opposed to PERSONAL care, then the care will paid for by the NHS?

Progress is made in a series of four-way meetings, face to face, sat round the table. There are no letters or phone calls except to arrange the meetings and to circulate the minutes of those meetings. Both parties and their Collaborative lawyers as well as making a commitment not to go to court, agree to a set of basic ground rules. Negotiations are based upon full financial disclosure, and when needed, other jointly instructed neutral professionals (such as accountants) can be brought in to assist in the process. Solutions are based upon the parties&rsquo; interests and needs rather than conflicting positions. Sometimes only a couple of meetings are needed, sometimes four or five. These meetings can be close together or widely spaced depending upon your individual circumstances. The choice is yours. Once agreement is reached, your Collaborative lawyer will make it binding for you and put the agreement into effect.

Unless you have stated otherwise, this will be 50% each for 2 owners or one third each for 3 owners etc. You are each free to use your share in any way you want. You can give it away during your lifetime, or can leave it to someone under your Will. Owning as Tenants in Common, the property will not automatically pass to the surviving owner(s) so it is <em>vital</em> that you each have a Will.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why is it important to own the right way?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You MUST own the property as Tenants in Common if you want to:-</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n<li>Give your share to someone else</li>\r\n<li>Leave your share under your Will</li>\r\n<li>Put your share into trust for someone else&rsquo;s benefit</li>\r\n<li>Engage in any inheritance tax planning</li>\r\n<li>Plan for future care fees</li>\r\n<li>Have extra flexibility in dealing with your assets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you don&rsquo;t know how your current property is&nbsp;owned, &nbsp;the chances are you own as joint tenants.

It also provides opportunity for the current generation to share proceeds with family members who are not participating in next generation.&nbsp; But how do you agree a fair price?

It could open up the opportunity for other non-family management to participate in ownership i.e. a Management Buy Out.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gradual handover</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When the current generation of owners accept that it is time to step back, for some businesses a more gradual handover may be appropriate. A gradual handover allows the current owners to be paid out over time which maybe better for the business financially and it also gives chance for younger family members to start getting involved in the business.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You might also consider a transfer of management before ownership. This would allow a balance between outright transfer and retaining some management control. You might want to ensure the next generation have the capability to run the business before handing it over and losing control altogether.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We can advise you and help you understand when voting control has transferred on a gradual handover.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Other things to consider in Succession planning</h2>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n<li>Every adult should have a Will &ndash; if you own a business then this is essential to plan for unexpected events.

More often than not people create Lasting Powers of Attorney in later life when there is a higher chance of mental capacity being lost through dementia for example.&nbsp; However, mental capacity can be lost at any age as a result of say, an accident so we would also advise anyone with complex financial affairs to have one as well.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At Banner Jones we can advise you on the best course of action for your particular circumstances.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of our most frequent questions would be:</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My father is elderly and has said that he would prefer me to deal with his bills and finances for him. Can I do this?</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As long as your father has mental capacity he could do this by giving you &ldquo;power of attorney&rdquo; which will allow you to look after things for up to a year for him. If he later loses mental capacity, however, then the power of attorney will come to an end.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Alternatively, your father could give you Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA). This would not come to an end if your father were to lose mental capacity later on, and will last indefinitely, not just for one year. We would need to see your father personally so we can explain the LPA to him and make sure this is what he wants. We would then be able to prepare a document for him to sign, which would give you power to deal with his finances on his behalf.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We will tailor-make the LPA to suit your father&rsquo;s wishes and we can discuss his options with him at the initial appointment. It cannot be used until it is registered with the Office of the Public Guardian, and we would be happy to deal with this too.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">What do I do next?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are always keen to find the best solution possible for your particular circumstances, and we know that no two families are the same.

This can be quite a demanding role and you should know what&rsquo;s involved before agreeing to become a trustee.</p>\r\n<p>Trustees have various duties and powers which are given to them either by the general law, the Trust deed (or Will) or a combination of both. It is essential that a Trustee understands the duties imposed on him and the powers available.</p>\r\n<p>If there is more than one Trustee they must act unanimously. Loosely:-</p>\r\n<p>\"<strong>Duties</strong>\" are&nbsp;<strong>obligations</strong>&nbsp;imposed on Trustees instructing them to do certain things. \"<strong>Powers</strong>\" are&nbsp;<strong>permissions</strong>, allowing the Trustees to do certain things.</p>\r\n<p>It is essential to consult the Trust Deed (or Will) itself to see what the powers and duties of a particular trust will be.</p>\r\n<p>Trustees manage Trust Funds on behalf of the&nbsp;<strong>Settlor</strong>&nbsp;(the person who sets up the Trust), for the benefit of the&nbsp;<strong>Beneficiaries</strong>. The Trustees must make sure that their actions are in the best interests of&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;the Beneficiaries. The Beneficiaries have the power to make sure the Trustees are doing so and they may take legal action against the Trustees if they act outside the terms of the Trust.</p>\r\n<p>All Trustees must be over 18 and mentally capable. They should ideally also have a sound financial history. It is possible for a Beneficiary to also be a Trustee but this can give rise to a conflict of interest. There is no limit to the number of Trustees a particular Trust can have (with the exception of land, where there cannot be more than 4 trustees), but it is strongly advised that there be at least 2. It is possible for a Trustee to retire but the other Trustee(s) must agree to this. It is not possible for you to retire if you are the only Trustee unless someone else is appointed to act in your place. Trustees should also remember that even after retiring they can still be held responsible for their actions before retirement.</p>\r\n<p>There are some circumstances in which a Trustee can be removed against their Will, for example if they are made bankrupt or remain outside the UK for more than 12 months or refuse to carry out their duties.</p>\r\n<h2>Duty to act impartially</h2>\r\n<p>The Trustees must invest the Trust Fund and generally administer the Trust in accordance with the Trust deed (or Will) and may take into account any letter of wishes. They must act fairly and impartially towards all the beneficiaries and must not benefit one beneficiary at the expense of another. They should treat all beneficiaries of the same class equally and of different classes fairly.</p>\r\n<h2>Duty to secure trust property</h2>\r\n<p>For example, this might mean that the Trustees would have to recover a debt owed to the Trust.</p>\r\n<h2>Duty to keep records</h2>\r\n<p>Trustees must keep records of what they do as they need these to prove that Trust has been properly managed. This includes keeping accounts, minutes of meetings and all other Trust documents. They must also allow inspection of these records by the Beneficiaries.</p>\r\n<h2>Duty not to benefit themselves</h2>\r\n<p>The Trustees must not make a profit out of the Trust for themselves &ndash; they must act as volunteers (although there is a power for professional Trustees to charge, as set out below). They must not profit either directly or indirectly, although this rule can be expressly excluded in the Trust deed (or Will).</p>\r\n<h2>Duty to enquire of Trust property</h2>\r\n<p>In other words, the Trustees must find out what assets are in the Trust, take control of them and ensure their preservation.</p>\r\n<h2>Duty to act with reasonable care and skill</h2>\r\n<p>Whenever the Trustees carry out certain functions (such as the power to invest, as set out below) there is a statutory duty on them to act with reasonable care and skill. The duty takes into account whether the Trustee is a professional and the level of knowledge and experience which he has or ought reasonably to have. Consequently, higher standards will be expected of investment professionals than of lay people.</p>\r\n<h2>Duty to keep investments under review</h2>\r\n<p>All the duties imposed on the Trustees require them to carefully consider the circumstances of the Trust, its Beneficiaries and investments on a regular basis. It is very important that every Trustee is actively involved in the administration of the Trust and in particular in the investment decisions. It is not sufficient for a Trustee to simply leave the decisions to his co-Trustees or for all the Trustees to simply leave the Trust investments in one place from year to year. They will need to hold a formal review and record the reasons for their decisions, at least once every year.</p>\r\n<p>A Trustee&rsquo;s powers will usually be contained in the Trust deed (or Will) itself and can be very wide-ranging. There are also powers given by the general law (unless they are excluded or amended by the Trust deed (or Will)):-</p>\r\n<h2>Power of Investment</h2>\r\n<p>Trustees have the same powers as an individual would have in relation to assets. To balance this power, the Trustees must have regard to:-</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The need for diversification&nbsp; and the suitability of the Trust&rsquo;s investments;</li>\r\n<li>The duty to keep investments under review; and</li>\r\n<li>The need to obtain and consider &ldquo;proper advice&rdquo; when making a reviewing investments.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Power to delegate</h2>\r\n<p>The law allows Trustees to delegate to an agent (such as an accountant or solicitor) any of their functions including the powers of investment. There are, however, 4 areas which cannot be delegated:-</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Dispositive powers (i.e. those relating to the distribution of Trust property);</li>\r\n<li>Power to decide whether payments should be made out of income or capital;</li>\r\n<li>Power of appointing new Trustees;</li>\r\n<li>Power of delegation itself.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Where Trustees delegate to an agent providing asset management services, the law requires a written statement called a&nbsp;<strong>Policy Statement</strong>, providing guidance to the agent as to how the Trust assets are to be managed. The agent&rsquo;s performance against this Policy Statement must be reviewed regularly.</p>\r\n<h2>Power to insure</h2>\r\n<p>Trustees may insure in full of the Trust property as if the property were their own. Insurance premiums can be paid out of income or capital of the Trust fund. It will not always be appropriate to insure Trust property, for example where the cost outweighs the benefit, but if the Trustees decide not to insure then they should set out their reasons for this decision, preferably in writing. They would then not be liable for any loss incurred.</p>','2011-03-03 12:16:10','2011-11-29 15:35:48','','',1,2,0,NULL,1,0,'<p>We can involve Independent Financial Advisors in our discussions at no extra cost to you</p>','108_iStock_000013859617XSmall.jpg','image/jpeg',98164,'2011-04-14 15:45:41','','family_highlight',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','Trusts.jpg','image/jpeg',57223,'2011-03-03 12:18:38','Trusts','','','Trusts','','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(131,'Property Matters','retirement_planning_property_matters','Property Ownership',128,0,0,1,'2010-04-29 08:55:42','<p>Believe it or not the way you own your property is very important if you want to leave a share of it to somebody in your Will. For example:</p>\r\n<h2>Owning as \"Joint Tenants\"</h2>\r\n<p>This way, neither of you owns an identifiable share of the property. You collectively own the whole thing - essentially you hold it on trust for yourselves. This means that when one of you dies, the property automatically passes to the survivor(s). It does not matter whether or not the deceased co-owner had a Will.</p>\r\n<h2>Owning as \"Tenants in Common\"</h2>\r\n<p>By owning this way, you each own an identifiable share of the property. Unless you have stated otherwise, this will be 50% each for 2 owners or one third each for 3 owners etc. You are each free to use your share in any way you want. You can give it away during your lifetime, or can leave it to someone under your Will. Owning as Tenants in Common, the property will not automatically pass to the surviving owner(s) so it is&nbsp;<em>vital</em>&nbsp;that you each have a Will.</p>\r\n<h2>Why is it important to own the right way?</h2>\r\n<p>You MUST own the property as Tenants in Common if you want to:-</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Give your share to someone else</li>\r\n<li>Leave your share under your Will</li>\r\n<li>Put your share into trust for someone else&rsquo;s benefit</li>\r\n<li>Engage in any inheritance tax planning</li>\r\n<li>Plan for future care fees</li>\r\n<li>Have extra flexibility in dealing with your assets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t know how your current property is&nbsp;owned, &nbsp;the chances are you own as joint tenants. However, we can easily check this for you. All we need is to see your title deeds.</p>\r\n<p>It is very simple to change from joint tenants to tenants in common. We would be happy to prepare the necessary paperwork and register the change at HM Land Registry on your behalf.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you are Tenants in Common already and want to change the share of the property that you each own, this can be done easily and we can provide an estimate of cost for you.</p>\r\n<h2>Equity Release Schemes</h2>\r\n<p>There are various schemes which allow you to release some of the value (&ldquo;equity&rdquo;) that is locked into your home. They allow you to obtain either a lump sum or a regular income or both without having to move home. There are a variety of different schemes available and you will need expert legal and financial advice if you are considering this as an option.</p>\r\n<p>Equity Release schemes have earned a poor reputation in former years, but the regime is now much more regulated than it was. We would still strongly advise you to seek proper legal and financial advice before considering it.</p>\r\n<p>To be eligible for any of the schemes available, you must generally speaking:-</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Be aged at least 60</li>\r\n<li>Own your own home</li>\r\n<li>Have paid off all or almost all of any existing mortgage over the property</li>\r\n<li>Own a property worth at least &pound;40,000</li>\r\n<li>Own a property built out of brick or stone</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>What different schemes are available?<br />The schemes fall under 2 broad headings: &ldquo;Reversion Schemes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lifetime Mortgage Schemes&rdquo;. Each type will have advantages and disadvantages.</p>\r\n<h2>Reversion Schemes</h2>\r\n<p>These schemes involve you selling all or part of your home to a Reversion Company. In return, you receive a lump sum or a monthly income. You and your partner can stay in the home, usually rent free, for the rest of your lives. When the property is eventually sold (usually on the 2nd death), the Reversion Company receives a % of the sale proceeds equal to the % of the property that they bought from you.</p>\r\n<h2>Lifetime Mortgage Schemes</h2>\r\n<p>This heading covers a variety of different mortgage schemes, all of which involve you borrowing money secured on the value of your home. Again, you can receive either a lump sum or a monthly income. You continue to own all of your home and the loan is repaid to the lender when your home is sold. You can choose whether to make interest payments or whether the interest is &ldquo;rolled up&rdquo; and paid back when the property is sold.</p>\r\n<h2>What will it cost?</h2>\r\n<p>There are all sorts of &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; costs including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Completion, arrangement or application fees</li>\r\n<li>Valuation fees</li>\r\n<li>Insurance</li>\r\n<li>Early repayment charges</li>\r\n<li>Legal fees</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Other considerations</h2>\r\n<p>You should also consider the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If your circumstances change in future, will you be able to move home?</li>\r\n<li>Any equity release scheme will affect the inheritance you are able to leave to your children or grandchildren</li>\r\n<li>There could be implications for your entitlement to social security benefits</li>\r\n<li>Who will be responsible for repairs and maintenance of the property?</li>\r\n<li>Tax implications</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Is Equity Release right for me?</h2>\r\n<p>It may be that you could consider other options instead, such as moving to a smaller property or cashing in other &ldquo;nest eggs&rdquo;, such as premium bonds or savings.</p>\r\n<h2>How can I find out more?</h2>\r\n<p>If you are considering releasing some of the equity in your home, please book an appointment and we will be happy to discuss your options.

Most recover from their injuries with time but the knock-on effect for others can mean long term disability, ongoing pain and continuing financial losses. If you have been injured as a result of an accident in a public place, such as a trip, slip or fall, then you could be entitled to make an accident claim to compensate you for your injuries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thousands of people every year experience some form of accident in a public place for which they could make an accident compensation claim. This could be the result of a trip, slip, fall or being struck by falling objects.</p>\r\n<p>The responsibility for the accident will often lie with the owner of the premises or property in which the accident took place or the local authority responsible for maintaining public spaces. They have a legal responsibility known as a \"duty of care\" to minimise the risk of accidents and where we can prove you were injured because that duty was breached, we&rsquo;ll pursue an accident compensation claim on your behalf.</p>\r\n<p>Call us now if you think you might have a claim or e-mail <a href=\"mailto:claims@bannerjones.co.uk\">claims@bannerjones.co.uk</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>','2011-05-09 15:04:28','2011-05-20 10:43:11','','',2,1,0,NULL,1,0,'<p>Call us now on 0333 200 2311</p>\r\n<p>or click here to email <a href=\"mailto:claim@bannerjones.co.uk\">claim@bannerjones.co.uk</a></p>','32_broken_leg.JPG','image/jpeg',105363,'2011-05-13 13:43:32','','family_highlight',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','SlipsAndTrips.jpg','image/jpeg',29372,'2011-05-20 10:43:11','Slips and Trips','','','Slips and Trips','','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(141,'Accidents at Work','accidents_at_work','Accidents at Work',136,0,0,1,'2010-04-29 08:55:42','<div id=\"c3581\" class=\"csc\">\r\n<div class=\"content\">\r\n<p class=\"teaser\">The HSE has stated that are 150,000 non-fatal injuries being reported each year whilst, sadly, 200 people lost their lives due to an accident or injury at work.&nbsp; In additional it is estimated that 2 million people suffer from ill health caused or exacerbated by accidents and injury at work.&nbsp; Whilst some of these injuries are minor, some have more serious consequences such as time off work, financial and emotional strain or even permanent disability.&nbsp; Whatever your circumstances, we\'ll be with you every step of the way.</p>\r\n<p class=\"teaser\">Compensation can go a long way to ease the burden that an accident and injury at work has caused and choosing the right solicitor for your case is one of the most important decisions you&rsquo;ll have to make.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"teaser\">There are many types of accident and injury suffered at work that you may be able to claim compensation for.&nbsp; Below are just a selection of the ones our team&nbsp;of injury solicitors will be able to help with:</p>\r\n<div class=\"teaser\">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Accidents on Building/Construction sites</li>\r\n<li>Mesothelioma Claims and other Asbestos related diseases</li>\r\n<li>Loss of hearing</li>\r\n<li>Hand Arm Vibration Syndrome</li>\r\n<li>Skin conditions</li>\r\n<li>Severe injuries resulting in amputation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Call us now for your free no obligation chat on 0333 200 231.

The adultery does not need to be the cause of the breakdown of the marriage. You do, however, need to be able to prove that your spouse has&nbsp;had sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex and it is not sufficient simply to suspect that adultery has taken place. It is best to ensure in advance that your spouse will agree that they have committed adultery.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You cannot petition for a divorce on the basis of your own adultery. In these circumstances either your spouse needs to petition for divorce on the basis of adultery or you need to be able to state a different reason for divorce.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Adultery cannot be used in cases of sexual intercourse with a member of the same sex.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. </strong><strong>Unreasonable Behaviour</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unreasonable behaviour is now the most common reason cited for divorce in England and Wales, in part because of its flexibility and ability to be used under varied <a href=\"http://www.solicitorssheffield.net/contact-us.html\"></a>circumstances. This might include violence, threats, abuse, mental cruelty, financial irresponsibility or even just prolonged failure to give emotional and practical support within the marriage. You can obtain a divorce if your spouse has behaved so unreasonably that you cannot be expected to continue living with him/her.&nbsp; You should be aware however that it is more than the fact that you simply do not get on any longer and that you have drifted apart and there needs to be some particular behaviour by your spouse that you can point to as being unreasonable.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Same sex couples can cite unreasonable behaviour if their partner has been unfaithful as a reason to dissolve their civil partnership.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3. &nbsp;Separation for two years and the other party consents to the divorce</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If your spouse refuses to agree, then you cannot obtain a divorce on this basis.You must be clear that the marriage was at an end before the two year period starts to run.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. <strong>Separation for five years when consent is not required </strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You will be entitled to obtain a divorce without consent after you have lived apart for a period of five years.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5.&nbsp; Desertion by the other party for two years&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can obtain a divorce if your spouse has deserted you and you have lived apart for a period of at least two years before starting the divorce.This is when your spouse has left you, against your will, for more than two years. The petitioning spouse must be able to demonstrate to the courts satisfaction that they always wanted their partner to return during this time, otherwise it is not desertion. &nbsp;Due&nbsp;to the other grounds for divorce that exist, it is very rare to come across a petition on this basis.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you would like to speak to one of our experts who can help you decide which grounds for divorce are most appropriate for your personal circumstance then contact us now.</p>','2011-08-11 11:14:12','2011-10-19 15:27:16','','',2,2,0,NULL,1,0,'<p>Fixed Fee Divorce</p>\r\n<p>A fresh approach ...</p>','65_iStock_000002761784XSmall.jpg','image/jpeg',140936,'2011-08-11 11:34:28','','family_highlight',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','',NULL,'/page/fixed-fee-divorce','',5,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(151,'Financial Settlements','financial_settlements','Financial Settlements',146,0,0,1,'2010-04-29 08:55:42','<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the first questions we often get asked is how will our finances be divided?&nbsp; Our experienced divorce solicitors in Chesterfield and Sheffield will work with you to achieve the best possible settlement available.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Financial settlement negotiations take into account several factors, including:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>The financial and other needs of any children</li>\r\n<li>The current earnings of both parties</li>\r\n<li>The potential future earning capacity of both parties</li>\r\n<li>Length of the marriage</li>\r\n<li>Standard of living enjoyed during the marriage and income needs</li>\r\n<li>Contributions that both parties have made to the marriage, both financial and otherwise &ndash; including looking after the house or caring for children</li>\r\n<li>Assets of each party, including accrued pension values</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Reaching an agreement on finances</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ideal solution is for an amicable financial agreement to be reached by negotiation between both parties and their solicitors. This will help to minimise legal fees and avoid the necessity of going to Court to reach a settlement.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If an agreement can be reached out of Court then your solicitor will draw up a consent order giving full details of the agreement reached. Both parties sign this agreement <a href=\"http://www.solicitorssheffield.net/contact-us.html\"></a>and it is then sent to the Court for a Judge to check it is reasonable before the Court endorses it as a legally binding order. We would always advise couples to try and come to an sgreement before having to go through the Court process.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What if we can&rsquo;t agree?</strong></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We would always advise couples to try and come to an agreement so to avoid having to go through the Court process but we know sometimes it is just not possible to agree.&nbsp;&nbsp;In these cases an application will be made to the Court and a timetable will be fixed. It is essentially a three stage process:</p>\r\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\" type=\"1\">\r\n<li><strong>First directions appointment \"FDA\":</strong><br />During the first stage both parties have to disclose their financial circumstances to the Judge. Our experts will deal with all the paperwork and ensure that everything is in order prior to the hearing. At this stage the Judge is checking that we have all the information we need and will give directions to progress the case to stage 2, for example, whether any valuations of property or businesses are required.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Financial dispute resolution hearing \"FDR\":</strong><br />Here the Judge will give guidance to the parties on areas of dispute and will encourage the parties to find a compromise solution which is fair to both of them. Most cases do settle at this stage.</li>\r\n<li><strong>The trial: </strong><br />If the case cannot settle, then a trial date will be fixed and the Judge will hear evidence from both parties and solicitors before deciding what should happen and making an order which the Judge considers to be fair.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Clean Break Agreements</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A clean break is a type of settlement where all finances are finalised at the point an agreement is implemented. It usually involves a split of assets between the parties with no ongoing spousal maintenance.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A clean break is also achievable in cases where spousal maintenance would normally be payable. If enough assets exist to enable the party liable to pay maintenance to transfer assets of a suitable amount, then this can negate the payment of maintenance on a capitalised basis.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once a clean break has been accepted by the court then neither party can try to claim additional assets or maintenance at a later date, no matter what their change of circumstances.<br /><br />A clean break applies only to your spouse. It is not possible to get a financial clean break in respect of your children as you have an ongoing financial responsibility to support them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All financial settlements are different as they are based on the circumstances of the individuals involved but our experts are here to guide you through the process and make sure you get your fair share of the matrimonial assets.</p>','2011-08-11 13:24:22','2011-08-11 14:17:09','','',2,2,0,NULL,1,0,'<p>If you have a Will in place with your spouse and you are getting divorced, do not forget to change your Will</p>\r\n<p>We can help you</p>','102_iStock_000012393462XSmall.jpg','image/jpeg',57204,'2011-08-11 13:44:17','','family_highlight',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','',NULL,'/page/making-a-will','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(152,'The Cost of Divorce','the_cost_of_divorce','The True Cost of Divorce',147,0,0,1,'2010-04-29 08:55:42','<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At Banner Jones Solicitors we want to give you the information you need to make an informed choice about getting divorced.&nbsp; It is important therefore to understand that the overall cost of the divorce&nbsp;process amounts to&nbsp;more&nbsp;than just the cost of the divorce itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are&nbsp;usually&nbsp;three different&nbsp;aspects involved, depending on&nbsp;the complexity of your&nbsp;circumstances:</p>\r\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n<li><strong>Divorce</strong>: this means the purely legal aspect of bringing the marriage formally to an end.

Discrimination can take a variety of forms including direct discrimination, indirect discrimination, harassment, victimisation, less favourable treatment and failure to make an adjustment. A brief summary of each of these is set out below.</p>\r\n<p>The following are the kinds of discrimination, which are against This Policy:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Direct Discrimination</strong> where one person treats another less favourably by reason of: <ol>\r\n<li>race or racial group (including colour, nationality and ethnic or national origins);</li>\r\n<li>their sex (including marital status, gender reassignment, pregnancy, maternity and paternity);</li>\r\n<li>sexual orientation (including their civil partnership status, perceived or actual orientation);</li>\r\n<li>religion or belief (including philosophical beliefs similar to a religion);</li>\r\n<li>age (perceived, actual, the age of others and it cannot be shown that the treatment in question is justified); or</li>\r\n<li>disability (including stress related illnesses, progressive illnesses and learning difficulties), and, </li>\r\n<li>in respect of age discrimination only, it cannot be shown that the treatment in question was justified.</li>\r\n</ol></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>To treat a person less favourably for other reasons, for example because they have not performed adequately, will not generally be regarded as discrimination amounting to professional misconduct unless the true reason for the treatment is, or includes, one of the matters referred to above.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Indirect discrimination</strong> where a provision, criterion, practice, requirement or condition (as appropriate) which is applied to everyone, has the effect of placing at a disadvantage a particular person, or group of people, by reason of:</li>\r\n</ol><ol>\r\n<li>&nbsp; <ol>\r\n<li>race or racial group (including colour, nationality and ethnic or national origins); </li>\r\n<li>sex (including marital status, gender reassignment, pregnancy, maternity and paternity); </li>\r\n<li>sexual orientation (including civil partnership status);</li>\r\n<li>religion or belief; and</li>\r\n<li>age,</li>\r\n</ol></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>and it cannot be shown that to apply that provision, criterion, practice, requirement or condition in that way is a proportionate means for achieving a legitimate aim.</p>\r\n<p>Note that the provisions relating to indirect discrimination are not applicable to discrimination on the grounds of disability.</p>\r\n<p>Indirect discrimination can occur whether or not the person applying the provision, criterion, practice, requirement or condition intended to discriminate against the person or group of people affected.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Victimisation</strong> when a person is treated less favourably because he or she:</li>\r\n</ol><ol>\r\n<li>&nbsp; <ol>\r\n<li>has asserted a right not to be discriminated against on one of the Prohibited Grounds;</li>\r\n<li>has assisted another to assert a right not to be discriminated against on one of the Prohibited Grounds; or</li>\r\n<li>has given evidence in a tribunal or court relating to the assertion of such a right.</li>\r\n</ol></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The protection applies only to assertions made in good faith.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Harassment</strong> when one person subjects another to \"unwanted conduct that has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment\", in other words threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour, words or actions which violate the other person\'s dignity or create a humiliating, intimidating or hostile environment. Harassment may involve physical acts or verbal and non-verbal communications and gestures. Harassment can also occur where it has the defined effect upon the victim, notwithstanding the harasser\'s intention - it is the effect which the harassment has upon the victim that is important. For example, remarks made humorously or without malicious intent can still constitute harassment if that is the effect which they had upon the person being harassed.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>In determining whether harassment has occurred you should be aware that a series of minor acts or comments can constitute harassment as can a one-off act of sufficient severity. However, the acts complained of must be capable of amounting to harassment.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Less favourable treatment </strong>(in disability discrimination only) when a person with a disability is treated in a detrimental way in circumstances when a person without that disability would not be so treated. For example, charging a person with a disability more than a person without because their disability means that more time is required to obtain instructions could constitute less favourable treatment, as could offering less favourable terms or refusing to act.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Failure to make a reasonable adjustment </strong>(in disability discrimination only) when there is a breach of the duty to take such steps (adjustments) as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that arrangements for Employees, Directors and clients, the premises from which business is undertaken and the services provided, do not put at a substantial disadvantage a person with a disability when compared with a person without that disability, without justification. The duty is a positive one to take active steps, physical or by making a change to working practices. The cost has to be borne by the Company.<strong></strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Exemptions</strong> <strong>and justifiable discrimination </strong>are permitted. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employment and Training</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General Statement</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>As an employer, the Company will treat all Employees and job applicants equally and fairly and not discriminate unjustifiably against them.&nbsp; This will, for example, include arrangements for recruitment and selection, terms and conditions of employment, access to training opportunities, access to promotion and transfers, grievance and disciplinary processes, demotions, selection for redundancies, dress code, references, bonus schemes, work allocation and any other employment related activities.</p>\r\n<p><strong>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recruitment and Selection</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The Company recognises the benefits of having a diverse workforce and will take steps to ensure that it recruits from the widest pool of qualified candidates possible.&nbsp; In this regard all job adverts will be free from bias.&nbsp; The Company will attempt to ensure that all adverts are seen by as wider range of applicants as possible. </li>\r\n<li>Employment opportunities are open and accessible to all on the basis of their individual qualities and personal merit.&nbsp; The Company&rsquo;s policy for recruitment is the best person for the job irrespective of race, sex, sexual orientation, religion or disability. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Targets</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The Company will use its best endeavours to comply with Law Society policies and targets for the employment of ethnic minorities, as are produced from time to time in accordance with the provisions of the Legislation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conditions of Service</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The Company will treat Employees equally and create a working environment which is free from discrimination and harassment and which respects, where appropriate, the diverse backgrounds and beliefs of Employees. </li>\r\n<li>Terms and conditions of service for Employees will comply with the Legislation.&nbsp; The provision of benefits such as working hours, maternity and other leave arrangements, performance appraisal systems, dress code, bonus schemes, termination of contract and any other conditions of employment will not discriminate against any Employee on the Prohibited Grounds.</li>\r\n<li>Where appropriate and necessary, the Company will endeavour to provide appropriate facilities and conditions of service which take into account the specific needs of Employees which arise from their ethnic or cultural background; gender; responsibilities as carers; disability; religion or belief; or sexual orientation. </li>\r\n<li>On induction the Human Resources Manager will take steps to ensure that Employees understand the terms of their employment and that they are aware not only of what they are expected to do for the Company but what the Company will do for them. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>(<strong>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work, Life, Balance</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The Company will endeavour to achieve a work life balance for Employees and Directors and will endeavour to consider the individual needs of Employees and Directors regardless of age, race, religion, disability or gender.&nbsp; In particular the Company where appropriate will consider the following:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Flexitime.</li>\r\n<li>Staggered hours. </li>\r\n<li>Compressed working hours.</li>\r\n<li>Job sharing.</li>\r\n<li>Term time working. </li>\r\n<li>Home or tele-working.</li>\r\n<li>Sabbaticals and time off work</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>(<strong>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fixed Term and Part-Time Employment</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The Company will treat fixed term and part-time Employees in a way which is as favourable to the way in which the Company will treat a full-time employee engaged in similar work unless there is any difference in treatment which can be objectively justified by the fact that whilst one particular term of the contract may be less favourable the contract taken as a whole is no less favourable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promotion and Career development</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Promotion with the Company including Directors will be made without preference to any of the Prohibited Grounds and will be based solely on merit.&nbsp;

Insurance contracts often stipulate that this cover is only available or can be exercised only where legal proceedings have actually been issued. It is sometimes extended to the period before then when investigations or enquiries are underway. Guidance from the Financial Ombudsman is such that insured persons <strong>should be free to request a solicitor of their own choosing where cases are complex or involve particularly difficult or sensitive issues or which involve employment disputes</strong>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>We can guide you further in relation to this aspect if you think you might be able to receive assistance in funding your legal advice and representation from us</strong>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We will tailor our service to meet your most pressing needs&nbsp;whilst keeping an eye on &nbsp;your budget.&nbsp; With this in mind, &nbsp;we can often offer you a fixed fee.

It also includes obtaining a consent order following an agreement of matters which were in dispute. It does not cover representation at a contested final hearing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5.&nbsp; <strong>Legal representation</strong><strong><br /></strong>This means that you can be represented at court if you are taking or defending court proceedings.

I apply detailed knowledge of the law and over 30 years of experience to support you through change.  For nearly 15 years I was the Banner Jones partner responsible for the Staveley office, which gave me a breadth of experience in legal problems.\r\n\r\nMy clients include parents and other relatives trying to make arrangements for contact with children, couples separating and needing me to deal with their finances, victims (both men and women) of domestic violence, parents and grandparents where social services have become involved with children.  I have for many years been a member of the Child Care Panel.  \r\n\r\nI am a Duty Solicitor and give urgent personal support to clients arrested or before the Magistrates. \r\n\r\nI focus on the issues that matter and advise you what your options are.  I believe in giving frank, straightforward and clear advice.  I ensure you know how the law applies to your case.  I support you to make the right choices, and put them into effect.  I am a member of Resolution and subscribe to their Code of Practice that can be found here: http://www.resolution.org.uk/.  Resolution commits family lawyers to resolving disputes in a non-confrontational way wherever possible.  I share the belief that family law disputes should be dealt with in a constructive way designed to preserve people’s dignity and to encourage agreement. \r\nFamily problems are most often based on in a lack of communication.  Negotiation, even at the door of the court, is very important in all areas of law but particularly family law.  There is not a week goes by when I am not at court personally advising my clients, representing their interests, and presenting their case.\r\n','Notable recent cases I have been involved in:\r\n\r\nRe: S (2012)\r\n\r\nI represented grandparents whose daughter’s baby was going to be taken into care.  I successfully argued that she should be cared for by my clients, and the case ended with a Special Guardianship Order being made in their favour.  \r\n\r\nRe:  M (2012)\r\n\r\nI ensured my client on divorce, had the matrimonial home transferred into her name, so that she retains the full value of the asset she brought into the marriage.\r\n \r\nRe:  W (2012)\r\n\r\nMy client was victim of significant abuse and violence from her former partner.  He denied everything.  After a full day’s court hearing the Judge agreed that all 18 of the allegations against him, including the most serious, were proven.\r\n\r\nRe:  C (2012)\r\n\r\nMy client’s baby was taken into foster care after birth.  Mother had a recent history of drug abuse and domestic violence.  I supported mother in her decision that the best interests of her daughter was adoption to a safe and secure family home as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nRe:  S (2012)\r\n\r\nMy client was a victim of domestic abuse and intimidation and manipulation by her former partner the father of her child.  I supported her and helped her to understand how she was being abused.  I directed her to the agencies that could provide her with help.  She grew in confidence and eventually with my help was able to make a complaint to the police.  Her former partner is now charged with harassment and subject to a restraining order.\r\n\r\nRe:  M (2011)\r\n\r\nMy client wanted contact with a child he had never met.  However he continued to be in trouble with the police.  I advised him what steps he needed to take before he could apply to the court for a contact order.\r\n\r\nRe:  C (2011)\r\n\r\nSocial Services alleged that my client’s toddler was at risk of harm from him and his partner and applied to take the child into care.  I successfully defended an application to remove the child and at the final hearing I argued my client’s case and the Magistrates rejected the social services’ concerns.\r\n\r\nRe:  C (2012)\r\n\r\nSocial Services alleged my client was by not able to protect his small boy.  At an interim hearing the Judge ordered that his son should be removed from his care but I arranged for assessments which resulted in him being returned to his father’s care and the family reunited.\r\n\r\nRe: C (2011)\r\n\r\nI acted for grandmother.  The her two grand-children lived with her.  Mother wanted them returned to her.  Over a long court case we answered objection after objection raised by mother to grandmother’s care of the children but eventually at a final hearing the arrangements were confirmed and an order made that the children should continue to live with their grandmother, my client.\r\n\r\nRe:  T (2011)\r\n\r\nMy clients received threatening letters from a solicitor instructed by grandmother demanding contact with their children.  I advised an approach which contained an offer of contact and a robust set of expectations from grandmother.  The grandmother solicitors’ letters were shown to be empty threats.\r\n\r\nRe:   V (2011)\r\n\r\nActing for mother in divorce proceedings I helped negotiate a mutually satisfactory agreement for the shared care of the children.\r\n\r\nRe:   H (2011)\r\n\r\nI acted for father who was accused of domestic violence towards his wife.  At the end of lengthy court proceedings Social Services accepted that mother had an alcohol problem which made the disharmony worse, and the children were placed in the primary care of their father.  We negotiated contact with mother, and also put in place a negotiated financial arrangement.\r\n\r\nRe: F (2011)\r\n\r\nFather and mother could not agree how to share the care of their young children.  On my advice mother had put forward a proposal for shared care that she considered to be in the best interests of the children.  Father alleged that the children were not safe in their mother’s care.  After a 3 day hearing the judge accepted my client’s case and rejected all father’s allegations.  The judge made an order in the terms of the proposal we had made.\r\n\r\nRe:  L (2011)\r\n\r\nDivorce proceedings were relatively straightforward but, although we made a number of offers, husband would not come to agreement on the financial matters.  At a final hearing, with evidence being given by both husband and wife, I established that husband had assets abroad that he had not properly disclosed and the full value of the matrimonial home was transferred to my client the wife.\r\n\r\nRe:  E (2011)\r\n\r\nMy client was the mother of a delightful little boy but her lifestyle caused social services to intervene claiming that she was unable to give him the care and attention that he needed.  I advised my client, and who agreed that her son lived with her parents, so she is able to continue to maintain a relationship with him and the threat of adoption was removed.\r\n\r\nRe:  S (2011)\r\n\r\nMy client, the husband, lived in the matrimonial home and although it was in his sole name had always agreed that his former wife was entitled to one half of it.
