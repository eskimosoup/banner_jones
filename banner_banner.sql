(1, 'Cash Flow is King', 'It was announced last week that the UK economy has officially come out of recession with figures for the last three months of 2009 showing growth of 0.1%.', '<p>Unemployment figures also fell last week for the first time in 18 months. Despite this encouraging news the reality for most businesses is that things will remain difficult for some time yet. Further factory closures such as Robert Bosch Limited in Wales, provide yet another stark reminder that the UK manufacturing sector, in particular, continues to be under threat from cheaper overseas production.</p>\n<p>The recent tough economic climate has given many business managers the opportunity to review overheads and cut out unnecessary costs. This is often the easiest way to make a business more profitable.&nbsp; One simple yet practical example is to ensure that correspondence is sent electronically rather than by post whenever possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For businesses that do find they are facing insolvency, whereby, a business is unable to pay their debts as and when they fall due, seeking professional advice at the earliest opportunity can help to safeguard the long term future and stability of the business.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When it comes to financial management the phrase <em>&ldquo;cash flow is king&rdquo;</em> is often used and for good reason.&nbsp; Many good businesses fail as a result of poor cash flow management.&nbsp; The key is to monitor both your creditors and debtors carefully; if cash flow becomes problematic speak to creditors early and try to initiate informal arrangements to defer payments temporarily.&nbsp; For example, HM Revenue &amp; Customs have been more prepared to agree deferred payment plans with businesses struggling to pay their tax bills than previously. If your business operates from rented premises then you should consider contacting your landlord with a view to negotiating a reduction in the rent. From a landlord&rsquo;s point of view, agreeing to accept a reduced rent is preferable to having empty premises or having to issue proceedings against a tenant to recover arrears.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With debtors, be similarly proactive, in the event of a default of payment immediate attempt to negotiate a repayment arrangement should be made.&nbsp; If payments are not been made legal advice should be sought with a view to instigating proceedings.&nbsp; The threat of legal proceedings will often be sufficient for a debtor to make payment.&nbsp; Care should also be taken in not extending significant credit to clients and customers.&nbsp; Whilst fulfilling orders keeps a business busy, you should be careful not to leave yourself overexposed with even the most longstanding of customers.</p>\n<p>For businesses that do get into financial difficulties the options that are available include the following, IVAs&rsquo; (Individual Voluntary Arrangements) &amp; CVAs&rsquo; (Company Voluntary Arrangements). The&nbsp;basic principle of IVAs&rsquo; &amp; CVAs&rsquo; is that the business in difficulty puts a&nbsp;proposal to its creditors to pay them a fixed amount in the pound of the debts owing.&nbsp; If the arrangement is accepted by the creditors then this allows the business to continue with reduced debt levels.&nbsp; Where debt is held individually rather than in a limited company name it can be more troublesome as the personal assets of the business owner, including their home can be under threat.</p>\n<p>Another option is Pre-Pack Administration &ndash; A Pre-Pack Administration is where the managers of an insolvent business agree terms with an Administrator to purchase the assets of the business with the Company being placed into Administration immediately after that.&nbsp; This form of corporate recovery can be controversial as a &lsquo;Phoenix&rsquo; business often begins to trade under a similar name by the same people, from the same premises having written off the debts of the previous business.&nbsp; In those circumstances maintaining trading relationships is often difficult however the other side of this argument is that in many cases, were the action not to have been taken, the business would have failed with the consequent loss of jobs and with creditors left in no better position.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Debt recovery comes in many guises from full scale insolvencies including company voluntary arrangements, partnership and individual voluntary arrangements down to simple debt negotiation and dispute resolution. Don&rsquo;t leave it too late to put your Debt Recovery plan in place because if a business is found to have traded whilst insolvent, then the Directors of that business can be made personally liable for any further debts incurred during that time. Can you take that risk?</p>', '2010-12-17', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2010-11-18 11:52:13', '2010-12-17 10:25:40', 1, 1, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),
(2, 'Family Values', 'Christmas 2009 may be a distant memory but how many of you shared your Christmas dinner with your business colleagues?  Research shows that around three fifths of UK companies with a turnover up to £5m are in fact family run businesses.', '<p>We hear a lot about the struggle to achieve a &ldquo;work life balance&rdquo; but family businesses have been taking their work home for decades. A 2009 survey carried out by South Yorkshire accountants Hawsons revealed that for 44% of family business discussions take place &ldquo;when and wherever&rdquo; and for a further 19% discussions take place &ldquo;at home&rdquo;. The Sunday Lunch Board Meeting is a common phenomenon in the family business; however, this can lead to issues of exclusion for directors, managers and owners who are not family members and also resentment from family members who are not involved in the business.</p>\n<p>Only 30% of family businesses survive to the second generation because sibling rivalry over contentious issues such as share ownership, succession and salaries all get in the way of forward business planning.&nbsp; As a family business grows and different generations start to join many family businesses take the decision to create a Family Charter (sometimes called family constitutions or protocols). This is a written document which creates a framework to support the formal business structures, and typically sets out how the family wishes the business to be run, the family&rsquo;s goals and the long-term strategy, the family&rsquo;s relationships within the business and how the family members should behave towards each other in the context of the business.</p>\n<p>The charter can also cover such issues as, who should be employed in the business? Who should be entitled to sit on the board? What happens if someone wants to sell their shares? And should in-laws be entitled to own shares?</p>\n<p>Having a Family Charter in place can boost overall staff morale through the knowledge that they are fully supported by the family rather than being treated as outsiders.&nbsp;&nbsp; No two Family Charters will be the same, but the process of working together to create a Family Charter can help the family and the business achieve long term growth objectives.</p>\n<p>So where will your family business be at the end of this new decade?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should you be taking stock and seeking professional advice on how to future proof your business?</p>', '2010-12-13', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', '2010-12-17 10:30:18', '2010-12-17 10:30:18', 1, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),
(3, 'Change of status...', 'Many new business start ups are either sole traders or partnerships but at some stage many of those will become a limited company.   The question is, are you better off being a sole trader or in a partnership rather than being a limited company (Ltd) or limited liability partnership (LLP)?', '<p>Quite often the format for running your business will have depended on your personal circumstances at the time of start up, but circumstances change as your business grows and it might be worth reviewing your options. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One of the major benefits from incorporating your business into a Ltd company/LLP is limited liability. This means that providing the rules are followed individuals will not take on personal liability for contracts and creditors.&nbsp;&nbsp; In these uncertain economic times this is not only an advantage for existing businesses but also for any budding Alan Sugar apprentices setting up a new business.&nbsp; Often a Ltd company will operate a number of separate divisions although these are still all part of the same Ltd company. You could also consider having a group structure.&nbsp; This protects an established profitable business from a new or untested business venture as each part of the group enjoys the protection of limited liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Care must be taken though, where &nbsp;the &lsquo;small profits rate&rsquo; for corporation tax has to be divided between associated companies.</p>\r\n<p>Roles in the business can be reviewed at this time especially when incorporating an existing partnership business into a Ltd company. This has tax planning benefits, as a shareholding director of a Ltd company can receive a salary, dividends and loan repayments.&nbsp; A &ldquo;silent partner&rdquo; may become a shareholder (&ldquo;investor&rdquo;) but not a director (&ldquo;manager&rdquo;) and key employees can become directors but not shareholders.&nbsp; Employees can &lsquo;participate&rsquo; and have non-voting shares and have a stake in the business without having any control. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>LLPs have been overlooked by many businesses despite the fact that they offer limited liability status with partnership style taxation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LLPs have been popular with many professional businesses which traditionally operated as a partnership, often due to the regulatory requirements of their governing body. &nbsp;We have a number of clients who successfully use both an LLP and Ltd for different aspects of their businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course having several types of business being run alongside one another does require more administration but the benefits can far outweigh the extra costs which may arise. One of the benefits to having both a Ltd company and a partnership is that it allows income sources to adapt quickly and tax efficiently which might be important following some of the potential changes in the first &ldquo;ConDemNation&rdquo; budget.&nbsp; We may see reductions to the small profits rate of corporation tax, changes to tax thresholds, NI rates and various other tweaks to the taxation system. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are however some perceived disadvantages to incorporation but this does not discourage over 300,000 new companies being formed every year.&nbsp;&nbsp; The public register at Companies House holds a Ltd&rsquo;s/LLP&rsquo;s accounts, however, as the accounts filing deadline is 9 months after the year end the information in these accounts may be out of date and of limited commercial value.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, it is common for banks, landlords and finance companies to still require personal guarantees whilst the newly formed Ltd company/LLP establishes a credit history.&nbsp; Where possible any personal guarantee should be limited to an agreed sum.&nbsp;&nbsp; In reality you are still better off providing a limited form of personal guarantee than having the unlimited liability associated with sole trader status.&nbsp; In terms of cost it is not expensive to set up a new Ltd company/LLP as the registration fees are just &pound;20 for the DIY route. It is recommended however, that you have a professionally prepared agreement regulating Ltd companies, LLPs and partnerships which will mean that the overall costs will be roughly the same. This is why most people choose to use a specialist solicitor or company formation agent so that they avoid potentially expensive mistakes and get the correct agreements in place from the start.</p>\r\nIf you are a new/start up business and would be interested in some advice on this subject why not come along to our free breakfast seminar at the Derbyshire &amp; Nottinghamshire Chamber of Commerce in Chesterfield on the 11<sup>th</sup> June at 8am.

(5, 'Is Your Business Free From Inheritance Tax?', 'Business owners usually try to use a tax efficient structure for their business, the question is which taxes are they trying to minimise? Income and Corporation taxes are top the list so that income can be extracted efficiently. Capital gains tax also on the list, especially for those preparing their business for sale. But what about Inheritance tax (IHT)?', '<p>Many business owners will be pleased to learn that they can make use of &ldquo;Business Property Relief&rdquo; which means that HM Revenue &amp; Customs will ignore certain business assets when calculating IHT. There are of course rules but if for the past several years you have owned the shares in your limited company which is a genuine trading company then the chances are that the value of the shares will be ignored when dealing with IHT on your death.</p>\n<p>Many business owners find that they have lost the right to this relief without realising.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the limited company has rented out its business premises with the result that the greater part of the company&rsquo;s income now comes from rental activity rather than trading activities. This may enough to result in the relief being denied or disputed with the result that your executors have to spend time and legal fees challenging tax authority&rsquo;s decision. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Selling your business can also result in an immediate loss of relief. For those fortunate enough to find a cash buyer then having sold the business you will no longer qualify for the relief &ndash; you now have a cash deposit in your bank account not shares in a trading company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many business sales are structured so that the final purchase price is dependent upon an earn out - the seller continuing to work in the business for an agreed time after the sale. We also see sellers trying to assist buyers with structures allowing the purchase to take place over an extended period of time. The IHT treatment will depend upon what you owned at the date of death &ndash; shares in a trading company or a right to receive payment for those shares at a future date &ndash;&nbsp;and the nature of the business activities undertaken by the company.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The valuable Business Property Relief can be wasted &ndash; if the business assets (which qualify in their own right as exempt from IHT) are left in a Will to an IHT exempt beneficiary (such as a spouse or registered charity) then this is not tax efficient.</p>\n<p>Inheritance tax is rarely at the forefront of anyone&rsquo;s mind when buying, running or selling a business. However with the prospect of a 40% tax bill on the value of your business assets perhaps it is time to review your business structure and draw up your IHT efficient Will, with a qualified solicitor of course.</p>', '2010-09-30', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', '2010-12-17 10:40:25', '2010-12-17 10:40:25', 1, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),
(6, 'Businesses Need More Than a Crystal Ball', 'How long has your business been around? Will it be here in 10 years? What about 100 years? To learn some lessons about businesses surviving through difficult economic times take a look at your local family owned businesses, particularly those who have survived through 3 or more generations. To survive the transition through several decades requires not only a very long term view but also a desire to ensure that there is a sound business there for the generations to come.', '<p>To survive through generations the business obviously needs to have a robust business strategy and we often find that excellence in customer service is often something that distinguishes a family owned business. By looking after and retaining their existing customers rather than constantly trying to acquire new ones has given many family owned businesses a point of difference and solid foundation to work from.</p>\n<p>But this is only one element.&nbsp; All businesses need to ensure they have access to capital.&nbsp;&nbsp; Older family owned businesses are particularly good at maintaining profits and cash in the business. This enables reinvestment into the company and helps maintain balance through turbulent economic times.&nbsp; It helps to have close family relationships with a sense of belonging and also to have no external shareholders demanding dividend returns is an advantage.</p>\n<p>In the knowledge that the business will benefit at the end of the mortgage term, very often we see family owned businesses buying their premises rather than renting. The commercial property market is still very touch but if a business has managed to maintain sufficient cash reserves to enable a sizeable deposit to be put down then purchasing premises is still something to consider to reap &nbsp;those longer term benefits. We also often see family businesses owning their premises separately to the business, which gives them the security that the wealth in the property is separate to the main business should they ever wish to diversify into newer riskier ventures.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many of our business clients have told us that they are trying to counteract the recession by going back to basics, focusing on looking after their customers, getting the job done quickly (at the right price of course) and making sure they get paid promptly for it. Hopefully we will all remember some of these valuable lessons as the economy struggles back.

Most businesses however would probably agree that treading water by maintaining turnover is just as important as increasing turnover at the moment.', '<p>Even a loss of turnover could be seen as positive to some as it may reflect a review of business operations, cessation of loss-making divisions or diversification. Trying to ensure that a business is in good shape to trade this year, next year and in 5 years time requires long term strategic planning.</p>\n<p>Some of the best examples of business longevity are family businesses.&nbsp; The names may evolve along with the product ranges but the culture behind the business continues. Many family businesses look to the long term future &ndash; trying to ensure that there will be a business fit for the next generation to take over in 20 years time. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Having a clear understanding about what is expected from the next generation is key. Do your children, nephews and nieces have the automatic right to join the business? Many children are lured into the family business by the promise of a comfortable salary and title status, where all too often the recipient neither has the skills nor experience to warrant this. This can undermine the position of the rest of the senior management team when faced with taking orders from the inexperienced boss&rsquo;s son or daughter.&nbsp; Should you therefore have eligibility criteria for joining the business such as relevant skills training? A family construction business for example would be better served by an architecture or civil engineering qualification, so an agreement as to the further education needs of the next generation may take place whilst they are still at school, ensuring their skills are aligned to the business profile.</p>\nPlanning for retirement is something we are all encouraged to think about as soon as we start working, however, family businesses will also need to plan for succession, not just in terms of financing an exit for the current owners but also in terms of ensuring that the next generation have the right attributes for the future success of the business.

Middle-class homebuyers are finding it harder than ever to secure a mortgage as high street lenders tighten criteria for securing a loan.', '<p>Last week, the British Bankers&rsquo; Association (BBA) warned that the number of newloans for house purchases had hit a 19-month low, while total mortgage lending wasat its lowest for a decade. One frustrated broker said that few of his applications forNatWest&rsquo;s best-buy two-year tracker, with a rate of 1.99%, had been approved. Thebank then came back with question marks on every single one. One broker said that onlyabout 10% of clients meet the requirements set by lenders for new borrowers. Peopleare now not even bothering to apply for a mortgage as they feel their chances of gettingaccepted are just too slim.</p>\r\n<p>There are currently 972 mortgage deals available from the biggest seven lenders &mdash; HSBC, RBS (including NatWest), Lloyds Banking Group (including Halifax), Barclays,Santander (including Abbey and Alliance &amp; Leicester), Northern Rock and Nationwidebuilding society &mdash; compared with 411 in 2006, according to Moneyfacts, the data provider. However, while the number of mortgages available has risen, applications being approved have slumped. The BBA figures show 70,895 loans were approved lastmonth, against 195,976 in 2006. Some borrowers who have secured a deal are havingfinance withdrawn at the eleventh hour after they have paid valuation and applicationfees. Agreements in principle (AIPs) are traditionally provided by lenders after an initialcredit check and assessment of a borrower&rsquo;s application, giving the green light to payvaluers and lawyers. However, AIPs are becoming less reliable and people shouldn&rsquo;tassume that they will still stand in two months.</p>\r\n<p>The sickly state of the mortgage market continues to push down house prices, which fell0.8% last month, according to the Land Registry.

By contrast, Chelsea buildingsociety has a three-year fixed rate at just 3.29% with a &pound;995 fee, available toborrowers with a 25% deposit.

These concerns are beginning to come more to the fore. Mortgage lending will be £9 billion this year, compared with £41 billion in 2008.', '<p>Half of all first-time buyers could be denied the mortgage theywant under planned restrictions that are causing deep concern across government.Plans from the FSA will mean mortgage applicants undergoing &ldquo;affordabilityassessments&rdquo; to show that they can pay significantly more than the cost of themortgage they want to take out.</p>\r\n<p>Proposals to restrict the terms of mortgages to 25 years and an end to &ldquo;selfcertification&rdquo;loans, which allow the self-employed to declare their income, are alsobeing considered. Interest-only mortgages will come under review next year. First-timebuyers already face serious obstacles to home ownership. Lenders are demandingsubstantial deposits and refusing loans or increasing interest rates for those who cannotraise them. I heard this week that ministers are deeply concerned that the pendulum infavour of regulation may have swung too far, storing up the potential for economic andsocial problems at a time when lending is already at a ten-year low. First-time buyersand those struggling with repayments are particularly vulnerable to the threat of higherinterest rates in the new year.</p>\r\n<p>The number of first-time buyers in the three months to September was 5 per cent lowerthan in the same period of 2009, as most lenders continue to shun those with a 10 percent deposit or charge exorbitant premiums of between 3 and 5 per cent. TheGovernment insists the rise in tuition fees to be decided this week, potentially saddlinggraduates with &pound;40,000 of debt, will not have an impact on their ability to borrow, butsome mortgage brokers have called this into question. Ministers believe the FSA iswrong to suggest that the changes will have a tiny impact on mortgage take-up, andthe Treasury is being warned that new regulations would encourage excessively riskaverse decision-making by banks. They have seized on Council of Mortgage Lenders(CML) estimates that show that under the proposals, 60 per cent of first-time buyerswould have been affected if the rules had been in place between 2005 and 2009. TheCML also calculates that 45 per cent of first-time buyers granted mortgages in the firsthalf of this year would have been rejected or allowed to borrow only a lesser amount ifthe mortgage rules had been in force. Overall, CML figures show that mortgage lendingwill be &pound;9 billion this year, compared with &pound;41 billion in 2008 and &pound;110 billion in 2006,as banks struggle to rebuild their balance sheets. However, the FSA has pointed out thatthe 350,000 borrowers in arrears and the 54,000 repossessions last year meant that itmust ensure that there was no return to risky lending.</p>\r\n<p>Two major charities, Citizens Advice and Shelter, said they supported the FSA&rsquo;s proposalsto introduce tough income and affordability checks on mortgage borrowers. An FSAspokeswoman said it was aware of the sensitivity of the issue. &ldquo;We are not rushing orimplementing changes right now, and we are incredibly mindful of the impact.&rdquo;Mark Hoban, the Treasury Minister, has told the Commons that he believes the FSA mustlook &ldquo;very carefully at the impact on home ownership and particularly on those peoplewho are looking to move shortly&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Grant Shapps, the Housing Minister, said he did not want the FSA micro-managing themarket. &ldquo;I welcome this review of the mortgage market, not least because we can seehow terribly things went wrong in the past,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is crucial, however, to ensurethat the review addresses the problems of the future, rather than trying to fix the gaping holes of the past.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, said: &ldquo;We must have amortgage market that is capable of responding to the increasing diversity and flexibilityof the UK labour market.

(10, 'Speed Up Eviction Plea Backed By 5,000 Signatures', 'A petition demanding changes in the current legal system for evicting tenants has been handed in to Downing Street. It was signed by almost 5,000 landlords after a campaign by Paul Shamplina, founder of eviction specialists Landlord Action, and the Residential Landlords Association, together with Sussex MP Mike\r\nWeatherley. The petition is aimed at speeding up the eviction process when there is clear evidence of anti-social behaviour or arrears on the part of the tenants.', '<p>The landlords are also seeking changes to the law to improve their rights ofaccess to their property, and they want assurances that the proposed closures of54 county courts will not adversely affect landlords. Alan Ward, chairman of theResidential Landlords Association, said: &ldquo;Landlords depend on the county courtsto dispense justice when tenants fail to pay the rent. If these courts are closed,we call on the Secretary of State for Justice to ensure that landlords and tenantsare not disadvantaged by delays in the court system.&rdquo; Paul Shamplina, ofLandlord Action, said: &ldquo;The private rented sector is growing and the Governmentneeds landlords to plug the shortfall in housing stock. Therefore, it&rsquo;s vital thatthere is a legal framework that properly supports them and encouragesinvestment within this sector.&rdquo; Mike Weatherley said: &ldquo;I wholeheartedly supportthis entirely sensible plan to balance the rights of landlords and tenants. It is alltoo easy to forget that landlords can be mistreated, just as tenants can be.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>What they haven&rsquo;t covered off is the issue of Housing Benefit. It used to be thecase that Councils would pay the rent of someone receiving Housing Benefitdirect to the Landlord. Now rent is paid to the Tenant. If they don&rsquo;t pay they haveto be 2 months in arrears before you can take action. That to me is insanity andif we are to prepare for a property market driven by rent rather than mortgagesthen the rules need to be changed. Former racing driver Sir Stirling Moss, alandlord with 40 properties, recently had to go through the full legal process toevict tenants who had not paid rent for seven months. They eventually left onthe eve of eviction by bailiffs, taking with them crockery, utensils, furniture andbed linen. Moss said: &ldquo;I consider myself a good landlord who is always fair, andI think the law is weighted against decent landlords like myself.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2>Renting Costs More Than Buying In Most Of Britain</h2>\r\n<p>Renting is now more expensive than buying in eight out of ten UK towns and cities.The figure is up from 74% in July as asking prices have come down and rentshave increased. On average, rents are now 9.9% more than mortgage payments.Research by Zoopla compares current asking prices to average rents for twobedroomflats in the 50 largest cities and towns around the country. Mortgagepayments were calculated assuming an interest-only mortgage at 5% p.a. In somelocations, the extra cost of renting is staggering. In York, rents exceed mortgagepayments by 39%: with average monthly rents at &pound;978, York tenants are &pound;3,270a year worse off than if they were buying. In a further 13 of the largest 50 citiesand towns, rents exceed mortgage payments by more than 20%.</p>\r\n<h2>Tenants Who Can''t Afford To Buy Squeezed By Rising Rents</h2>\r\n<p>I''m&nbsp;not sure the rental market in Chesterfield is as buoyant as it is nationally.Generally rents appear to have reduced over the last two years rather thanincreased. However, four in ten tenants believe rents will be higher in 12 months&rsquo;time. A Rightmove survey of 2,636 current and prospective tenants also showsthat 55% of tenants would like to buy a home now, but cannot afford to do so.Only 13% said they had no interest in home ownership. Meanwhile, with rentalstock down 23% compared with a year ago, Rightmove says there is chance ofa let-up in rent rises. Commercial director Miles Shipside said that are cases ofgazumping in some areas, and he described some tenants as &ldquo;trapped renters&rdquo;.He said they were unable to get on the housing ladder because of high depositsand credit scoring criteria. The survey shows that one in three tenants plan tostay in rented accommodation for at least three years.</p>', '2010-11-25', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', '2010-12-17 10:56:32', '2011-01-21 14:55:31', 1, 1, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

The fuller assessment looks at 11 different areas of the person&rsquo;s health and their care needs to decide where is the best place for them to live. This includes looking at their mobility, their breathing, their continence, their mental state etc. There are 4 possible outcomes of the assessment &ndash; the person could return home, move into residential care, need residential care with some nursing, or need full nursing care. If the person is assessed as needing the last of these options then the costs of their care will be paid in full by the NHS. If any of the other 3 outcomes are reached, then the elderly person is likely to be assessed as to how much they should pay towards the cost of that care.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes mistakes are made in these assessments, or the complicated means-testing rules are not followed correctly. This can mean that some people end up paying more for their care than they need to.</p>\r\n<p>DID YOU KNOW... you can challenge the decision if you are not happy with it? We can advise you on the rules that should have been applied and can help you to appeal against a decision. We can represent you at panel meetings or can liaise with the Primary Care Trust or the Local Authority on your behalf.

(13, 'Do you own or run a business? Got a contingency plan?', 'If you have a business, a partnership or are a company director then you should consider appointing a Power Of Attorney. This allows you to delegate decision-making to your attorney if for any reason you can’t be there to make the decisions yourself. You can limit their power to a specific time frame and also limit the decisions they are able to make for you. For example, if a lease for new premises needs to be signed on the 29th of the month, when you will be in the south of France, you can nominate someone to have power to sign that specific lease on that specific day.', '<p>You can also give a much wider power to someone like your business partner. This would mean they can step into your shoes whenever they are needed to sign papers or make decisions at any point in the future, say if you were ill. In fact, when 2 or 3 people are in business together this would be a sensible step to take, to ensure business continuity.</p>\r\n<p>Appointing an attorney can be important in your personal life as well, particularly if you have lots of assets/investments. What if something happened to you tomorrow and you could no longer write a cheque, or sort out your direct debits, even get cash out of the bank... what would you do? People can lose the ability to do all these things in all sorts of ways &ndash; a skiing accident, a car crash, a stroke, dementia or even a routine stay in hospital!</p>\r\n<p>By creating a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) you can choose someone you trust to take charge of your finances if you need them to. You can choose more than one person if you like, or one person with a &ldquo;back up&rdquo;, just in case. The LPA must be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian before it can be used. But once that has been done, it can take effect whenever and as often as you need it. It can last for the rest of your life or whatever other timescale you choose.</p>\r\n<p>Obviously, by giving someone power to look after your finances like this there are risks. Your attorney would have complete control and could sell your house and all your assets. There are 2 main ways of safeguarding against this. Firstly, when the LPA is registered you can choose up to 5 people who must be told. These people can act as &ldquo;whistleblowers&rdquo; and speak up if they suspect anything is amiss. Secondly, you can place restrictions on your LPA to prevent your attorney from doing certain things. We would however, always urge caution on restrictions though as your circumstances can change and what might not be appropriate now, may be necessary in the future. For example, you might not want your attorney to be able to sell your house right now. But what if 10 years from now you had a stroke and needed residential care? It might be essential that they have power to sell your house in those circumstances.</p>\r\n<p>To be able to set up a LPA you must have the necessary understanding of what is involved. Sadly, many people leave it too late and come to us &ndash; or, rather, their families do - to set one up when they have advanced memory problems or dementia. If you don&rsquo;t have the necessary &lsquo;mental capacity&rsquo; then you can&rsquo;t create a LPA. How many times do we hear &ldquo;Oh, if only we had come to you sooner&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>So don&rsquo;t leave it too late. We like to think of a LPA like an insurance policy. We hope you will never need to use it, but you will have the peace of mind of knowing it is there just in case.</p>\r\n<p>Richard Barlow is a senior solicitor in our private client team and would be delighted to discuss the appointment of an attorney with you.

(14, 'Back to School', 'School fees at some private secondary schools are often in the region of £10,000 a year; and if we assume that a child spends 7 years there it is realistic to expect the total cost per child to approach £100,000 once you factor in additional costs such as uniforms, books and trips.', '<p>We see an increasing number of grandparents assisting or fully funding these fees. The death of trusts for grandchildren has been widely reported over recent years but as quoted by Mark Twain, reports of their death may have been exaggerated. Certainly the tax treatment of trusts has become more onerous but for each grandparent wishing to set aside a maximum of say &pound;100,000 which will be &ldquo;used up&rdquo; by the time the grandchild reaches the age of 18, tax treatment may not be as significant as press reports would have us believe.</p>\n<p>The creation of a discretionary trust for the benefit of grandchildren can still be a useful tool.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the selection of appropriate trustees grandparents can have the assurance that this pot of money is ring fenced and can only be used for certain purposes and not by the parents of the grandchildren.</p>\n<p>Treating your grandchildren fairly (rather than equally) may also be an issue, as it is possible that some of your grandchildren may need your support more than others. On the other side of the family there maybe other sets of grandparents who are willing to assist with school fees and you might want to take this into account so wealth is shared fairly.&nbsp; By using independent trustees you can ensure fairness is taken into account when making decisions about fees in the future.</p>\n<p>Grandparents are often concerned that without their continuing financial assistance a grandchild&rsquo;s school fees could not be paid without some element of hardship on their children. Whilst grandparents may be happy to set up direct payments to the schools during their lifetime consideration should also be given to how payments can continue to be made in the event of their death.</p>\n<p>Our advice to grandparents will always focus initially on their own future financial needs. With the death of a spouse the household income may reduce &ndash; particularly if payments from an occupational scheme reduce by 50% to the surviving spouse. However in the event of the death of both grandparents then consideration may be given to making a further lump sum payment into the trust for their grandchildren rather than leaving all of the assets to their children (the parents).</p>\n<p>So as the new school term gets underway it is perhaps time for grandparents to do their own homework and make an appointment with a solicitor.</p>\n<p>Sarah Nadin is a specialist trust solicitor and member of STEP.

If you don&rsquo;t, and there is a conflict between your Will and other arrangements, your Will will always take precedence.</li>\r\n<li>Then, create a list of your online accounts, memberships, passwords etc and decide which account is to pass to whom. Specify on that list if any of your accounts are to be deleted after your death.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve seen examples of deceased&rsquo;s Facebook accounts being left open giving their friends and relatives the opportunity to leave memorial messages, but if you don&rsquo;t want this to happen then you will need to specify that your account be closed in your Will.</li>\r\n<li>Nominate a &ldquo;digital executor&rdquo; in your Will to handle the transfer of your accounts after your death. This doesn&rsquo;t have to be the same person as the one who deals with your &ldquo;real&rdquo; assets. Your digital executor would then have the right to access your accounts.&nbsp; Anyone who isn&rsquo;t a digital executor could be on shaky ground legally speaking if they try to access your accounts without the right to do so. &nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Another thing to think about and include in your Will are the details of any online billing sites that you use i.e. for mobile phones and online services. &nbsp;It can be difficult to establish the liabilities on death and cancel the services if the executors do not know who the deceased bought services from. The estate may end up with unnecessary bills if the accounts/services aren&rsquo;t terminated, and not all organisations will agree to cancel charges from the date of death. These bills will come off the total estate so it&rsquo;s better to get these sorted as soon as possible.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Planning for the future in such a way is never something high on most people&rsquo;s priorities, but perhaps it should be and, more importantly, perhaps this is something you want to point out to your parents. Silver surfers are becoming increasingly active, and many will have a mix of both traditional and on line accounts; so it might be worth making sure they have not only written a Will but, within the Will, have detailed all of their digital assets so that they are not lost forever.</p>\r\n<p><strong>For more information on Wills, or a codicil which takes into acount your digital legacy; arrange an appointment with our expert Wills and Probate department.<br /><br />Call 0330 017 6309</strong>*<strong>&nbsp;or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@bannerjones.co.uk">info@bannerjones.co.uk</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p>*<strong><sub>calls cost no more than a local 01 number and are included in your mobile minutes.</sub></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><sub>&nbsp;Image courtesy of Ambro at FreeDigitalPhotos.net</sub><strong><br /></strong></p>', '2015-04-07', 'to do will post it.png', 'image/png', 1396709, '2015-04-07 11:56:43', '', '2010-12-17 11:17:11', '2015-04-07 13:43:34', 1, 2, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin');

Chief Executive Peter Bolton King predicted the rise of ‘postcode power’ as premium areas emerge from the slump at a faster rate than others.\r\nAny recovery, he warned, will be strongly dependent on the major lenders making mortgage finance more available. Bank of England decisions on interest rates will also have a major effect on the market. The monthly wait for the MPC’s decision on interest rates will be a nervous time for both existing and potential borrowers.\r\nHowever, Mr Bolton King said that, while the housing market faces a tough year, he was confident that no widespread drop in house prices would occur.\r\nHe said: “The housing market remains in a state of fragile recovery as the year ends. Frankly, however, this recovery is threatened by the stubborn refusal of major lenders to loosen their self-serving restrictions on mortgage lending.”\r\n“A historically low rate of interest has benefited those people who already have a mortgage, but it is likely that over the next 12 months it will rise. That will place more pressure on existing borrowers but also remove mortgages from the reach of even those house buyers with large deposits.”\r\n“The danger is that a backlog of pent-up demand for property emerges. That means the market will suffer from lack of demand in the short term and potentially be distorted by a rush of demand when these people can finally get onto the ladder.”\r\nHe added: “We do not believe that there will a widespread fall in house prices over the next 12 months. There will be ups and downs, but I’m confident that we won’t see a plunge.\r\n“What we will see is the emergence of ‘postcode power’ – as demand for property in some areas fuels a healthy market while other, less desirable areas, are in danger of being left behind.”\r\n', '<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fluctuating Market Sees House Prices Increase</strong></p>\r\n<p>After months of downward pressure, UK house prices actually increased by 0.8% between December and January, according to the latest Halifax House Price Index.</p>\r\n<p>However, prices in January were 2.4% lower than the same period a year earlier.</p>\r\n<p>There are likely to be some monthly fluctuations with the prospects for the market in 2011 closely aligned with the performance of the wider economy.

Research by unbiased.co.uk, a website that allows you to search for mortgage brokers and financial advisers, indicates that nearly 50 per cent of borrowers have not reviewed their mortgages since the base rate dropped to its record low. It says that many borrowers have been lulled into a false sense of security by their lower monthly costs.</p>\r\n<p>Separate research by MarketGuard, the specialist insurer, suggests that nearly three million borrowers would struggle to afford their mortgages if interest rates increased by only 1 per cent. This number rises to nearly five million people if rates rise by 2 per cent. Borrowers often leave it too late to switch to a fixed rate, waiting until after the base rate starts to rise and all the best deals have disappeared.</p>\r\n<p>The rates that lenders pay to fund fixed-rate deals have been on an upward trend since October, despite a dip at the end of last month after disappointing GDP figures. During recent weeks a number of lenders have increased the price of fixed-rate deals and many more are expected to follow suit as demand grows. ING Direct and Northern Rock both increased rates by up to 0.4 percentage points on some of their fixed deals last week. First Direct increased the price of some fixed and tracker mortgages by up to 0.3 points, as well as increasing fees on certain products by up to &pound;500.</p>\r\n<p>Opinions are divided over when base rate is likely to rise. Andrew Sentance, a member of the Bank of England&rsquo;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, has been voting for a rate rise for many months. Last month he was joined by a second member of the nine-strong committee in calling for an increase.</p>\r\n<p>The Council of Mortgage Lenders says that it is &ldquo;quite possible&rdquo; that rates will stay at 0.5 per cent for the rest of this year. Others believe that the MPC will cave in to market pressure to raise rates much sooner and says that there could be a quarter-point rise as early as next month. He expects the base rate to end the year at 2 per cent and to reach about 3.5 per cent within five years.</p>\r\n<p>Mortgage brokers say that trying to guess when the base rate will rise is a bad strategy because it is impossible to predict. If you are on a variable rate, however, it is crucial to check that you would still be able to afford your mortgage if rates increase.</p>\r\n<p>Many borrowers who have seen their loan-to-value ratio increase because their property has fallen in value relative to the size of the home loan, or who no longer meet lenders&rsquo; criteria, could be forced to stay on the lender&rsquo;s SVR because they do not qualify for new, cheaper, deals.</p>\r\n<p>Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, the housing charity, says: &ldquo;So far, low interest rates have been crucial in helping struggling homeowners to stave off repossession and keep a roof over their head.&rdquo; Mr Robb warns that even a small rise in interest rates could push many borrowers over the edge. (The charity has a free helpline for homeowners on 0300 3300515).</p>\r\n<p>Second-guessing what will happen with interest rates is a tricky game to play and borrowers are best to consider how well they are equipped to deal with rate increases.</p>\r\n<p>Looking at how monthly payments will be affected by rate rises will help borrowers to decide how much they value the protection afforded by a fixed rate and I expect a growing number to choose this option.</p>\r\n<p>Other borrowers who are prepared to accept the risk of interest rate volatility, and who believe that increases are likely to be gradual, may stick with tracker deals.</p>\r\n<p>Good advice is to try to overpay while interest rates remain low, to help to soften the payment shock when rates begin to rise. Some lenders will allow borrowers to reserve fixed-rate deals up to six months in advance.</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately there is no right or wrong; fix for comfort, track to speculate and accumulate.</p>', '2011-02-10', 'CHRIS SELLARS2.jpg', 'image/pjpeg', 188017, '2011-02-21 16:13:53', '', '2011-02-21 16:13:57', '2011-02-21 16:13:57', 2, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

The report said confidence in March stagnated, holding just above a two-year low, as households waited to see if they would benefit from tax measures in Britain''s annual budget.</p>\r\n<p>Official data released last week showed that last year British households suffered their first annual real-terms fall in disposable income since 1981.</p>\r\n<p>Nationwide expects demand for houses to remain fairly soft and a rapid increase in the supply of properties also appears unlikely.</p>\r\n<p>With the economic recovery expected to remain sluggish, the most likely outcome is that the property market will follow suit, with low transaction levels and prices moving sideways or modestly lower through 2011.</p>\r\n<p>Nicholas Ayre, a director of UK buying agents Home Fusion, said of the Nationwide house price figures: "Never has a monthly price rise been less representative of the state of the property market. Given the state of demand, the recent trend of price rises the Nationwide has observed is likely to be short-lived ... the only thing that seems to be falling, and sharply, is consumer confidence."</p>\r\n<p>A separate survey by Hometrack, the property research company, added to the gloom.</p>\r\n<p>It said house prices in England and Wales fell at their fastest annual rate in 17 months in March and only strong demand in London prevented an even bigger decline.</p>\r\n<p>Prices fell by 3.2% in March compared to a year ago, according to Hometrack - the biggest fall since October 2009, when Britain was emerging from an 18-month recession.</p>\r\n<p>On the month, prices fell by 0.1%, the smallest drop since July, after a 0.2% dip in February.</p>\r\n<p>However, Hometrack said London''s relatively strong performance flattered the monthly figure, masking bigger falls in every region except southwest England where prices were unchanged.</p>\r\n<p>House prices are expected to continue to fall during 2011, dragged down by tight lending, government spending cuts and tax rises, high unemployment and low wage growth.</p>', '2011-04-08', '42_SELLARS_MARKET_header.JPG', 'image/jpeg', 100374, '2011-04-08 09:54:56', '', '2011-04-08 09:54:56', '2011-04-08 09:56:17', 2, 2, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

This is the first optimistic prediction for many months, after a slew of downbeat figures have suggested the housing market is moribund. \r\nEarlier this month, the Halifax said that the average cost of a home dropped 1.4pc during April to the lowest level since July 2009. The lender also suggested that 64 per cent of young people who did not own their own home had completely given up on the dream of being an owner occupier, as restrictive mortgage conditions meant it was impossible to get on the housing ladder. \r\n', '<p style="text-align: justify;">The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has also said that until mortgage lenders started to relax their conditions, and consumer confidence picked up, they could see no sign up house prices returning to growth.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the weekend, the property research group Hometrack said house prices in England and Wales fell by 0.1 per cent in May following a drop in the number of house-hunters registering with estate agents.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the CEBR has said that &ndash; despite property values continuing to fall for much of 2011, ending the year around 1.4 per cent lower than they started it &ndash; the market will begin to stabilise towards the end of the year, when the UK''s property shortage will once again underpin prices.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Improvements to the major banks'' balance sheets should lead to them loosening their strict lending criteria, enabling more people to buy a home.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The severe shortage of new homes, caused by the financial pressures faced by house builders and a lack of demand, will eventually lead to an economic readjustment. The CEBR said with just 130,000 new homes built in 2010, around half the level needed to keep pace with the growing number of households, prices should increase by 16 per cent between 2011 and 2015, the equivalent of a gain of around 4 per cent a year.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This level of growth would see the market return to a more healthy level after the boom and bust of recent years, when prices raced up at 9 per cent a year on average from in 2007 and 2008, before crashing 10.5 per cent in 2009.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Douglas McWilliams, the CEBR''s chief executive said: "We think the market is currently close to the bottom for the UK as a whole. The main factor driving house prices up is the shortage of available housing which has already pushed up rents.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">"Housing completions fell to only 130,000 in 2010, well below the level required to keep pace with demographic change."</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Other property experts are not convinced by CEBR''s optimism. There is certainly a huge amount of pent up demand. But whether that translates into higher house prices depends on whether banks and building societies respond by lending money to consumers.</p>\r\n<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Secret ''95 Pc Mortgage'' Proposals ''Will Help Young First Home Buyers''</h4>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Secret talks have reportedly been held between senior executives from several FTSE-listed companies, leading banks and the Council of Mortgage Lenders in an attempt to ease the supply of finance. It was claimed that all the main lenders, including Lloyds and Santander, and some of the country''s largest house builders, including Taylor Wimpey, Barratt and Persimmon, attended the meeting.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One proposal understood to have been discussed during last week&rsquo;s talks would involve house builders creating a special fund, in which significant sums of equity would be injected into. The fund, which would be ring-fenced for each house builder, would then be used by banks to underwrite mortgages for up to 95 per cent of a property&rsquo;s value.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The disclosures come just days after the Bank of England warned families of a bleak few years and the prospect of rising interest rates.

(36, 'Is Equity Release Right For You?', 'Equity release schemes are an increasingly popular way to fund retirement. Official figures show that as much as £205 million was accessed via equity release schemes in the UK in 2010. But is it really right for you? \r\n\r\nThere are two types of equity release deal: lifetime mortgages and home reversion schemes. They are available only to older homeowners. Some schemes have a minimum age as low as 50; for others, the age limit is 70. \r\n\r\nLifetime loans, otherwise known as roll-up mortgages, are a type of home loan on up to 50 per cent of a property’s value, so you must pay interest on how much you borrow. The younger you are, the higher the rate of interest. However, repayments can be rolled up and are paid in full when the property is sold or when the borrower dies or goes into long-term care. \r\n\r\nReversion schemes, for homeowners above the age of 65, involve selling all or part of your home to an equity release company, then living in it rent-free until you die, or until you go into long-term care. At this point, the company sells the property and takes its cut from the sale proceeds, which will include any growth. \r\nAsk yourself the eight questions below when you try to determine whether or not equity release really is right for you. \r\n', '1. Do you want to reduce the value of the estate you leave behind to your family? \r\nThis is an important question to ask yourself and it is always worth remembering that any equity release scheme will reduce the value of the inheritance you leave for your family. \r\n\r\n2. Do you want to involve your family in your decision? \r\nAs question one highlights, equity release will have an impact on how much money you leave behind when you are gone. It may be wise to involve your family in your decision in order to avoid any disputes when you are gone. \r\n\r\n3. Will it affect your benefits? \r\nEquity release schemes can affect your ability to claim state benefits. You should think about this before you consider committing to a scheme. Speaking to a lawyer can help determine how equity release may affect your entitlement. \r\n\r\n4. Will you want to pay the equity release loan back early? \r\nReleasing cash from your home is a lifetime commitment – most equity release loans are only expected to be repaid when you die or if you go into long term care. If you want to repay the loan earlier you may have to pay additional costs. \r\n\r\n5. Can you borrow money in another way? \r\nYou may need cash, but you may not need an equity release scheme in order to access it. Ask yourself if you could get money via a standard loan or mortgage before considering the equity release route. \r\n\r\n6. Should you just downsize? \r\nHome is where the heart is and many people do not want to move when they no longer need to live in such a large property, no matter how big their home is. Before undertaking an equity release scheme ask yourself if you’d prefer to simply sell up your property and move somewhere smaller. \r\n\r\n7. Should you take professional advice? \r\nEquity release schemes should not be entered into light-heartedly and they can affect your benefit payments, as well as your inheritance and estate planning options. Consulting a lawyer before moving forward with a scheme could be useful. \r\n\r\n8. Will you want to move house? \r\nYou can move home under equity release schemes, but the process is obviously slightly more complicated, as you will need to move the equity release loan to the new property. The new property will also have to meet certain criteria to enable you to move the loan. \r\nWith property prices having increased considerably over the last two decades, it is no surprise that people are increasingly relying on their house to help fund their retirement. Releasing equity from your home could be a great way to fulfil your retirement dreams. \r\nReleasing equity from homes is a trend that is likely to continue for many years to come, but make sure that the scheme you choose is right for you and your own specific needs before committing to a plan. \r\n', '2011-07-15', '69_iStock_000003465599XSmall.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 245782, '2011-07-15 11:17:29', '', '2011-07-15 11:17:30', '2011-07-15 11:17:30', 2, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

Where the employer fails to comply with these provisions, the Employment Tribunal (ET) can require the payment of a protective award.', 'In Phillips v Xtera Communications Ltd., the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) held that in situations where the number of employee nominees or candidates matches the number of representatives to be elected, it is not necessary for the employer to conduct a formal ballot in order to satisfy the statutory requirements regarding the election of employee representatives.<br />&nbsp;<br />Mr Phillips worked for Xtera Communications Ltd. at its Harold Wood site. In May 2008, the company was considering closing the site as part of a programme of substantial cuts. Members of staff were notified by email that more than 20 jobs could be lost and that a formal process of consultation would be undertaken. It was suggested that two employee representatives would be sufficient to negotiate with the company and staff were invited to indicate whether they wished to hold an election. If candidates were proposed and an election desired, this would be arranged.<br />&nbsp;<br />The employees held a meeting and agreed on two nominees to act as their representatives. Mr Phillips did not attend the meeting but signified to colleagues that he was in agreement with the decision taken. The company contacted all staff asking if there were any objections to the two people whose names had been put forward being elected and no objections were forthcoming. When one of the original nominees stepped down, a replacement came forward. A third person then volunteered to act as an additional employee representative. The company agreed to this and no objection was made by any employee regarding the revised arrangements.<br />&nbsp;<br />In the event, the Harold Wood site was kept open with a reduced workforce. Following a redundancy selection process, Mr Phillips and one other staff member were made redundant.<br />&nbsp;<br />Mr Phillips made various claims to the ET, including a claim for a protective award. He contended that the employee representatives were not elected in accordance with TULRCA because Xtera Communications had failed to comply with its obligation to arrange an election process. The ET rejected this claim.<br />&nbsp;<br />On appeal, the EAT held that Section 188A of TULRCA does not expressly require that a ballot be conducted or a vote be undertaken in every circumstance. Where the number of nominees is the same as the number of representatives sought, an election would merely involve the employer expending valuable time and resources on a wholly unnecessary exercise.<br />&nbsp;<br />Although the employees in this case were not given the opportunity anonymously to object to the candidates, it was open to anyone who dissented to put their own name forward or to nominate another candidate. Also, any staff member could have requested that a formal election be held. No such responses were made.<br />&nbsp;<br />Furthermore, the ultimate safeguard against manipulation of the democratic process is the duty on the employer, under TULRCA 188A(1)(a), to ensure that the election of employee representatives is fair.<br />&nbsp;<br />The appeal was therefore dismissed.<br /><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />If you are contemplating making staff redundant, we can advise you to ensure that the appropriate arrangements are put in place', '2011-10-05', '55_iStock_000001814995XSmall.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 132191, '2011-10-05 08:33:39', '', '2011-10-05 08:33:39', '2011-10-05 08:34:55', 2, 2, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

In deciding whether a director took every step to minimise the loss to creditors, the court assumes he knew there was no reasonable prospect of the company avoiding the insolvent liquidation, even if in fact he did not.</p>\n<p>The aim of the wrongful trading laws is to make directors of companies that are getting into financial trouble, who might otherwise try to trade out of trouble, stop and think carefully about whether they are being over-optimistic about the company’s prospects.</p>\n<p>When judging what the director knew or ought to have concluded, and the steps he should have taken, the court asks itself two questions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, it looks at the director’s functions. It asks what a reasonably diligent person with the general knowledge, skill and experience required of someone exercising those functions would have concluded and the steps he would have taken. This is an objective test, under which, say, a finance director will be expected to reach the minimum threshold of competence required of all finance directors.</li>\n<li>Second, it looks at the general knowledge, skill and experience that the director actually has &ndash; a subjective test, under which a director with specialist skills or experience is expected to apply them, and is therefore subject to a higher standard than a director without those skills or experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the first case a start-up company was set up in late 2002. By August 2005 the original, substantial, external investment in the company had been used up, the company had lost a major customer and its revenue was insufficient to reduce the overall losses it had built up. It was wound up as insolvent by a creditor in 2007.</p>\n<p>The liquidator alleged wrongful trading because, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There was no evidence that the directors had considered the company’s worsening financial situation and its potential effect on creditors. They ought to have done so and ought to have concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent liquidation.</li>\n<li>The directors had not economised &ndash; they had continued to spend money as they had previously, including paying themselves salaries and expenses. They had not taken ‘every step’ with a view to minimising the loss to creditors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The court decided they were guilty of wrongful trading, from June 2005.</p>\n<p>In the second case, the directors behaved much better. The company started trading in Spring 2004. By December 2005 it was having trouble finding external funding. The directors took advice from a specialist insolvency practitioner and decided to carry on. However, a major supplier withdrew its services in January 2006 and the company was unable to find a replacement. The directors immediately decided to stop trading and the company was put into liquidation by creditors.</p>\n<p>The liquidator alleged wrongful trading at four separate times. However, the court said that, even though the company was under-capitalised and always had cashflow problems, the court could understand why the directors had behaved as they did at each of those times. Particularly as their decisions had been objectively justifiable and they had: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>taken creditors’ interests into account in their decision-making.</li>\n<li>made sure they knew the company’s financial position at all times.</li>\n<li>actively tried to find fresh funding.</li>\n<li>monitored and controlled the company’s debts.</li>\n<li>tried to find new business.</li>\n<li>taken specialist advice.</li>\n<li>made their own decision to stop trading.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Recommendations</b></p>\n<p>Directors of companies in financial trouble who wish to avoid allegations of wrongful trading should take the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure they always have adequate and timely financial information.</li>\n<li>Be alert to danger signs, such as pressure from creditors.</li>\n<li>Draw conclusions from the circumstances that a reasonably prudent business person would have drawn.</li>\n<li>Hold regular board meetings to discuss/review the company’s situation.</li>\n<li>Ensure they consider the interests of creditors as well as comply with their statutory directors’ duties.</li>\n<li>If there is a prospect of insolvency, do not incur new liabilities as if there was nothing wrong.</li>\n<li>Record conclusions.</li>\n<li>Take specialist, professional advice, consider it carefully and follow it unless there are very good reasons not to.</li>\n<li>Consider stopping trading and starting appropriate insolvency proceedings before creditors do.</li>\n</ul>', '2012-01-11', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2012-01-18 12:53:56', '2012-01-18 12:53:56', NULL, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'http://feeds.bhpinfosolutions.co.uk/category/Legal-News/feed/'),

If they apply, it means the owner of the database can stop someone else extracting or reusing all, or any <i>substantial</i> part, of the database, except in certain limited circumstances.</p>\n<p>The law says that extracting or reusing <i>insubstantial</i> parts of the database, if done repeatedly and systematically, can amount to extracting or reusing a substantial part of the database.</p>\n<p>The court had to decide whether there had been a substantial extraction of data from the database generally, and/or whether the repeated and systematic extraction of individual records for the mailing by GP and BDM amounted to a substantial extraction.</p>\n<p><b>Quantity and quality</b></p>\n<p>The courts can take either a qualitative or a quantitative approach when deciding whether records amount to a ''substantial part'' of a database. If they use a qualitative approach they look at the financial and human investment required to put the database together. If they use the quantitative approach, they compare the number of records extracted against the overall size of the database.</p>\n<p>The data in the publisher’s database was collected by sending out thousands of questionnaires, with phone follow-up. It was then entered and checked. The publisher spent around &pound;82,000 per year on the research and around &pound;30,000 entering and checking the data. The court found that the publisher had made a significant financial and human investment in the surviving records, whether 6,000 or 4,783.</p>\n<p>Quantitatively, it also decided that both 6,000 (14 per cent) and 4,783 (11 per cent) records amounted to a substantial part of the database (although at the low end of substantial), but decided this partly because of the time and effort required to create each record and keep it up to date.</p>\n<p>The court therefore seemed to be saying that the more investment has been made in building a database, the lower the proportion of it that needs to be extracted or reused in order to infringe the owner’s database rights, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>It also said that, if insubstantial parts of a database had been repeatedly and systematically extracted for the purposes of a mailing, but they could be recombined to rebuild a substantial part of the database, then that could amount to extraction of a substantial part. It ruled that the insubstantial parts extracted for the GP/BDM mailing could be so recombined, so that their mailing infringed the rules too.</p>\n<p>These comments give useful guidance to owners and users of databases, and their clients.</p>\n<p><a name="comment"></a><strong>Recommendation </strong></p>\n<p>Businesses using databases, or parts of databases, that they have not created themselves should ask the supplier for legally binding warranties (and indemnities) that they do not infringe any third party’s database rights, particularly where the records represent a significant financial and human investment, amount to a significant proportion of the total database or can be combined to rebuild a significant part of the database.</p>', '2011-12-05', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2012-01-18 12:53:56', '2012-01-18 12:53:56', NULL, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'http://feeds.bhpinfosolutions.co.uk/category/Legal-News/feed/'),

Condition 7 says:</p>\n<p><i>"An error or omission only entitles the buyer to rescind the contract: (a) where it results from fraud or recklessness, or (b) where he would be obliged, to his prejudice, to accept property differing substantially (in quantity, quality or tenure) from what the error or omission had led him to expect".</i></p>\n<p>The owner said that the misrepresentation did not make the property substantially different from what the buyer expected, so the buyer could not rescind the contract &ndash; that is, treat it as if it had never been entered into.</p>\n<p>The law governing unfair contract terms says that clauses limiting a person’s liability for misrepresentation (or restricting the legal remedies available to the other side) has to be fair and reasonable, given the circumstances when the contract was made. The buyer argued that Condition 7 was not fair and reasonable. The court agreed with the buyer.</p>\n<p>On appeal by the seller, the Court of Appeal said it could only interfere with the original decision if it was plainly and obviously wrong. It started by saying that Condition 7:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Was not "self-evidently offensive" but was a commercially justifiable apportionment of risk in the interests of certainty and the avoidance of litigation.</li>\n<li>Had been incorporated into contracts for the sale of land for many years.</li>\n<li>Was endorsed by the Law Society.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It also took account of the fact that both buyer and seller had been advised by solicitors and had negotiated amendments to other Conditions, but not Condition 7.</p>\n<p>However, it went on to acknowledge that there were exceptional features to this case. For example, the seller knew the development potential of the land was very important to the buyer, so that the buyer would not have exchanged contracts had he known of the planning application. These meant that, in the circumstances, Condition 7 was not fair and reasonable, and the buyer could rescind the contract.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>\n<p>Sellers should</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure that initial replies to a buyer’s enquiries before contract are accurate.</li>\n<li>Make sure their replies are refreshed if circumstances change or risk the contract being rescinded for misrepresentation, even if the Standard Commercial Property Conditions are incorporated into the contract.</li>\n</ul>', '2011-10-28', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2012-01-18 12:53:57', '2012-01-18 12:53:57', NULL, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'http://feeds.bhpinfosolutions.co.uk/category/Legal-News/feed/'),

It owns copyrights in the broadcasts of live Premier League matches which it makes available via satellite, selling exclusive licences to broadcasters in each EU country giving them the sole right to broadcast those matches to their subscribers in that country. </p>\n<p>To protect its copyrights, the FAPL requires each broadcaster to encrypt the satellite signal provided to the subscribers, which means subscribers in each country need a decoder device to see the matches. Crucially, the licences stop each broadcaster from providing its decoders outside its territory. In the UK, there is also a law that stops people in the UK from using foreign decoders &ndash; aimed at stopping them from accessing satellite broadcasts from another EU country.</p>\n<p>A pub landlady from Portsmouth used a Greek decoder and showed Greek broadcasts of the matches to her customers. This was cheaper than using a UK decoder. The UK High Court asked the ECJ to rule on 18 different issues arising from the dispute, to help it make its own decision. Among its ruling, the ECJ said:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>foreign decoders were not an illegal ‘illicit device’, even if obtained using a false name and address and even if supplied in breach of the licence terms, since ultimately the FAPL was still being paid for their use;</li>\n<li>the clauses in the FAPL licences stopping broadcasters from one EU country from selling their decoders to people in another EU country were against EU competition law;</li>\n<li>the UK law stopping people importing, selling or using foreign decoders was against EU law on the freedom to provide services throughout the EU, for which there was no ‘objective justification’.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, the ECJ also said that people were not allowed to screen broadcasts containing certain copyright materials (known as ‘protected works’) belonging to the FAPL without permission. These do not include on-pitch action, but do include, for example, Premier League logos, music and pre-recorded highlights. The live matches the pub landlady was accessing using the Greek decoder did contain protected works, and she did not have the FAPL’s permission to show them.</p>\n<p>In making this ruling, the ECJ clearly took into account that the landlady was screening the matches for profit.</p>\n<p>The ECJ has now remitted the dispute back to the High Court to rule on the case.</p>\n<p><b>Recommendation</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pubs and other venues showing Premier League football matches for profit should not rush to buy foreign decoders until the High Court has issued its ruling – particularly on the issue of whether they can show broadcasts that include FAPL copyright materials without prior FAPL permission.</li>\n<li>Those wishing to access matches for their own use using foreign decoders should take specialist legal advice.</li>\n</ul>', '2011-10-28', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2012-01-18 12:53:57', '2012-01-18 12:53:57', NULL, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'http://feeds.bhpinfosolutions.co.uk/category/Legal-News/feed/'),

The Commission has now produced an updated version, <i>Equality Act guidance for charities - Restricting who can benefit from charities</i>.</p>\n<p>However, to take advantage of the exception, a charity must show that the limitation is either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a ‘proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim’ &ndash; which must be supported by ''particularly convincing and weighty reasons''; or</li>\n<li>a way of compensating for a perceived disadvantage. For example, a charity may be able to show it is compensating for a perceived disadvantage if it is set up to help the unemployed of a particular nationality or ethnicity, but only if unemployment is particularly high among these groups compared to unemployment for other groups.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The guidance makes clear that the limit must actually be in the charity’s constitution if it is to rely on either test. For example, if it has broad objects but simply chooses to limit who it benefits, it cannot rely on either test.</p>\n<p>It also makes it clear that the same rules apply to donations or bequests made on condition that the donation may only be used to benefit a particular group, or grants given to pursue the charity’s objects.

In consequence, the debt should be considered a family, not an individual, &nbsp;misfortune.</p>\r\n<p>Much consideration was given to the wife&rsquo;s contribution to the marriage and to the success of the husband&rsquo;s business. The court heard how the business had been established shortly after the couple&rsquo;s wedding.

The court heard how the wife had helped and encouraged her husband to realise his dream to recreate the products and build a business based upon them.

Non-EU signatories to the Convention include Albania, Australia, Croatia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Morocco, Switzerland and Uruguay. \r\n', '<p>Justice Minister Lord McNally promised that the Government would ensure that children from the UK and other countries are protected no matter where they or their parents live.

The Convention provides a method to return a child abducted by a parent from one signatory state to another. The Convention was drafted to ensure the prompt return of children who have been abducted from their main country of residence or wrongfully retained in another country. The aim of the Convention is to deter a parent from crossing international boundaries in search of a sympathetic court. It only applies to children under the age of 16.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>From 1 November 2012, a whole range of court decisions involving children moving to and from participating states has been enforced under the Convention. These include decisions as to who has parental responsibility, to what extent and how it can be used, custody rights, the right to decide the child&rsquo;s place of residence, and rights of access.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Convention is not retrospective, however, and only applies to decisions about the protection of a child taken on or after 1 November.

There was an exception if a lease specifically allowed a tenant to apportion rent in anticipation of the successful exercise of a break.

However, is opting for a new house or flat your best option?</p>\r\n<p>A raft of government and industry-backed finance schemes have been launched to encourage builders to build more, but poor workmanship, delays and unexpected costs can all turn a buyer''s dream into a nightmare. At the end of 2011, Which? surveyed 200 homeowners who had bought new in the past five years and found that more than half had experienced problems.</p>\r\n<p>"A new-build home can appear less problematic than buying an older property, and it may be easier to get a mortgage, especially with a small deposit," said a Which? spokesperson. "However, you could experience delays in the completion or be hit with unexpected costs."</p>\r\n<p>Here we take a look at what you need to know before you decide to buy new.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Finance packages available</strong></p>\r\n<p>The interest-free loan part of Help to Buy will be offered from 1 April 2013 and limited to people who want to buy new-build. It is similar to the existing First Buy scheme, but this time it is available to existing homeowners as well as first-time buyers. First Buy was launched in September 2011 and, according to the government, by September 2012, 7,000 people had taken it up.</p>\r\n<p>Under Help to Buy, borrowers need to raise 5% of the value of the property, but can borrow a further 20% on an interest-free basis from the government. The biggest loan available will be &pound;120,000.</p>\r\n<p>The loan must be repaid when the property is sold. However, if you want to repay it in part or in full, without selling your property, you can do this by "staircasing", or paying back in stages at any time as long as 12 months have passed since the property was purchased.</p>\r\n<p>After five years, the loan will attract interest at 1.75%, which will rise annually by the RPI rate of inflation plus 1%.</p>\r\n<p>Last week, NatWest launched its Help to Buy offering: a two-year fix on a 75% loan-to-value at 3.15% with no fee. Halifax has a two-year fix at 3.89% with no fee or at 3.49% with a &pound;999 fee.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pros of buying new-build</strong></p>\r\n<p>Plenty of people buy new-build because of the perceived lack of hassle with maintenance and the fact that you in effect have a blank canvas on which to make your mark.</p>\r\n<p>New homes also tend to be more energy efficient &ndash; though you might be surprised that many are not more so. They must have an energy efficiency rating of at least C (rates are between A and G), with higher requirements for housing association and council homes. Many do not score above C &ndash; so don''t necessarily expect to buy an A rated home if you are buying new.</p>\r\n<p>The majority of new-build homes also come with a guarantee from the builder. If the property is registered with the National House Building Council (NHBC), it''ll come with a 10-year warranty and protection scheme.</p>\r\n<p><strong>... and the cons </strong></p>\r\n<p>The biggest downsides are often cited as depreciation and space. A new property is only ''new'' for a very brief period, and you will be paying a premium for its newness, much as you do when you drive a new car out of a showroom.</p>\r\n<p>Plenty of buyers make a commitment to buy before the property is finished, and often rely on the developer''s show home to get an idea of what they''re signing up for. However, developers will use crafty tricks to make you think there is more space than there is. Furniture will often be minimal and scaled down to give an illusion of more space.</p>\r\n<p>For example, a double bed will be 4ft rather than the more standard 4ft 6in. Flattering lighting, wall mirrors and glass-topped furniture can all add to the feeling that you''re buying a much bigger home than you are.</p>\r\n<p>A shiny new property can also hide a multitude of sins.

(219, 'Top 10 Tips When Joining Forces To Buy A Home ', 'Buying a property is one of the most important decisions you''ll have to make. It''s a significant investment and most people take this step with someone else.\r\n\r\nLaw Society Chief Executive Desmond Hudson said "sharing the financial burden of the purchase and the day-to-day costs of living together has its advantages, but negotiating the complexities of joint ownership can be tricky. \r\n', '<p><strong>Banner Jones </strong>&nbsp;has extensive experience of advising a wide range of clients on the property-buying process. Many people believe that if they buy a home together, they will automatically have rights to the property if they break up or the other person dies, but this is not true in every case.</p>\r\n<p>To help people better understand what''s involved with joint property ownership, we''ve compiled a list of the top ten things to be aware of;</p>\r\n<p>1. <strong>Think about how you want to own the property</strong> - you can own the house or flat in equal or unequal shares. How and why you do that may depend on your own circumstances but it is best to be clear about how much of the property each of you will own at the outset, otherwise it could be very difficult to work out what each of you is entitled to if the relationship ends.</p>\r\n<p>2. <strong>Inform your mortgage lender</strong> - the names on the mortgage deed must match the names on the Land Registry Entries so make sure your bank is kept informed of any changes. If you want to change the names on the deeds you will need your lender''s permission to do this.</p>\r\n<p>3. If one of you already owns the property <strong>check whose name is on the title at the Land Registry </strong>- this may determine who has legal rights to the property if the property is sold or the relationship breaks down.</p>\r\n<p>4. <strong>Record who pays for what </strong>- keep a record of each party''s financial contribution to the property including mortgage payments, household expenses and the cost of repairs, maintenance or extensions. If there is a dispute over shares in the property, a court may take these factors into account.</p>\r\n<p>5.<strong> Don''t forget about initial deposits and other financial contributions</strong> - it can be tempting to think ''we''ll just divide things up equally if we break up'', but it is important to give careful consideration to each party''s contributions. If one of you has put more money towards buying property, for example, by paying the whole of the deposit, you may wish to reflect that in the size of their share of the property or the money from selling it.</p>\r\n<p>6. <strong>Discuss moving out </strong>- if you are buying a property with a group of friends or family, give some thought to what would happen if one of you wished to move out and how their share would be transferred. In most cases someone moving out might mean the property has to be sold.</p>\r\n<p>7. <strong>Whatever you decide, tell us </strong>- your conveyancer will be able to advise on the best way of documenting and protecting your interests in the property. This is often by writing a Declaration of Trust.&nbsp; Although it will cost money think of it like an insurance policy. You pay a premium to compensate you if your house burns down and your possessions are lost. In the same way, if you do not protect your contribution to the property you may lose out.</p>\r\n<p>8. <strong>Consider<a href="../../page/making-a-will" target="_blank"><strong>making a will</strong> </a></strong>- however you own your property, you should consider making a will to record who you want to inherit your share. Many people mistakenly think that if they own a property jointly, their partner will automatically inherit their share, but this is not always the case. We can advise you about wills.</p>\r\n<p>9. <strong>Get the best advice </strong>- many solicitors with expertise in property buying are members of<strong> </strong>the Law Society''s Conveyancing Quality Scheme<strong>. </strong>This is the quality mark for property legal experts, recognised by the UK''s biggest mortgage lenders. CQS gives you reassurance that you are in safe hands.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Banner Jones</strong> underwent rigorous assessment by the Law Society in order to secure CQS status, which marks the firm out as meeting high standards in the residential conveyancing process.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Follow me on Twitter </strong><strong>@bannerjones</strong><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Contact me at Banner Jones 24 Glumangate Chesterfield</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Tel 01246 560560</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Fax 01246 220390</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href="mailto:cjs@bannerjones.co.uk"><strong>cjs@bannerjones.co.uk</strong></a><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>www.bannerjones.co.uk</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '2013-05-21', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', '2013-05-21 10:23:11', '2013-05-21 10:23:11', 2, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

Since 2007 landlords have been required to protect any deposits taken with an authorised scheme or face the prospect of a tenant claiming damages of three times the deposit value.  In reality however, landlords could avoid protecting the deposit right up until the day before the hearing and still escape liability.  \r\n', '<p>This all changed following the introduction of the Localism Act 2011 which came in to force on 6<sup>th</sup> April 2012. It is now the case that if a tenancy deposit has been taken from a tenant, it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span> be protected within a recognised scheme within 30 days and the tenant <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span> also be provided with Prescribed Information (relating to where the deposit is held and other specific information). &nbsp;If these requirements are not complied with within the 30 day limit, the tenant will immediately be entitled to issue a claim against the landlord for the return of the deposit together with additional damages of up to three times the deposit value.&nbsp; This claim can even be made after the tenancy has ended. &nbsp;As such, if a landlord has failed to protect a deposit within 30 days, we would advise they pay it back to the tenant, sooner rather than later to avoid a claim.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if a landlord needs to seek possession of their property they would be greatly restricted if a deposit has not been protected.&nbsp; A landlord is unable to serve a valid s21 notice seeking possession until the deposit is returned.

That means looking beyond the headline prices we highlight here and doing some good old-fashioned groundwork closer to home.</p>\r\n<p>The Land Registry''s most recent quarterly data, which provides the broadest measure of actual house prices paid across the board, showed a decline in the months to December 2012 but prices up year-on-year.</p>\r\n<p>The average price for all property was up 4.3% annually to &pound;238,293, but that was a 4.7% fall over the three-month period.

Two-fifths (42%) still see access to mortgage finance as a barrier to buying a home but this is the lowest percentage recorded since the BSA began its study at the height of the credit crunch in June 2008.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Problems Ahead</strong></p>\r\n<p>Lenders have made it much tougher to take out cheap interest-only loans, which had helped prop up the property market. A squeeze on interest-only has been in place since the financial crisis hit but has dramatically stepped up a gear last year.&nbsp;The effects of this should not be underestimated. Those with existing interest-only mortgages are finding their lenders will not let them borrow more to move unless they switch to a repayment loan which comes with much higher monthly payments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The second problem is that lenders are still cash-strapped and the eurozone debt crisis is weighing heavily on the banking sector. This has contributed to a dramatic fall in swap rate money market costs and the fixed rate mortgages that these heavily influence. If things get worse banks will find their balance sheets hammered.</p>\r\n<p>The cost of moving is also high. Those buying family homes in areas where a property costs more than &pound;250,000 face a stamp duty bill of at least &pound;7,500.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Follow me on Twitter </strong><strong>@bannerjones</strong><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Contact me at Banner Jones 24 Glumangate Chesterfield</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Tel 01246 560560</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Fax 01246 220390</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href="mailto:cjs@bannerjones.co.uk"><strong>cjs@bannerjones.co.uk</strong></a><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>www.bannerjones.co.uk</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '2013-06-04', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', '2013-06-04 09:34:45', '2013-06-04 09:34:45', 2, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

There had been a "near disappearance of government-funded research on housing since 2010", the Rics study added.</p>\r\n<p>It called for the creation of an independent committee to advise politicians from all parties on housing supply, and a new body bringing together private-sector and academic research on housing. It also said ministers "must carefully review the introduction of their welfare reform measures and... be vigilant that the unintended consequences do not outweigh any benefits".</p>\r\n<p>In particular, the under-occupancy penalty on housing benefit claimants in social housing deemed to have surplus bedrooms should not apply where the tenants are unlikely to find alternative suitable accommodation in the area, it said.</p>\r\n<p>Rics also criticised the Right to Buy scheme - under which council housing tenants can buy their homes at a discount - which it said "frequently reduces the supply of affordable rented homes in a locality", and called for it to be replaced.</p>\r\n<p>Housing minister Mark Prisk said the government was "fixing all areas of the dysfunctional housing market it inherited".</p>\r\n<p><strong>Prices Still On The Up</strong></p>\r\n<p>England''s house prices were driven up last month by a 6pc rise in London and a 3.6pc rise in the East Midlands. In the latest House Price Index from the Office for National Statistics the average cost of a house in the UK rose to &pound;238,000.</p>\r\n<p>The year-on-year increase reflected growth of 2.8% in England and 6.2pc in Wales, which were offset by declines of 1.2% in Scotland and 0.8% in Northern Ireland.</p>\r\nEngland''s house prices were driven by a 6% rise in London to an average of &pound;414,000 and a 3.6% rise in the East Midlands to an average of &pound;171,000. Prices across the UK were up 0.4% month-on-month. Overall, the property market is much healthier than it was this time last year but take out London and the South East, and the average growth figure falls to 1.4%\r\n<p>First time buyers have been hit hardest by increasing costs. The ONS figures showed that first-time buyers paid 4.7% higher on average than a year earlier, compared to those who already owned, who paid just 1.9% more. Higher house prices mean overcoming bigger barriers to access the market, locking out anyone unable to raise a substantial deposit.</p>\r\n<p>The number of mortgages on the market has increased sharply and lenders have slashed their rates since the Government launched the Funding for Lending scheme last August.</p>\r\n<p>In support of Rics view, the government''s Help to Buy scheme does appear to be working, with 4,000 extra reservations on news builds in the first two months of the scheme.</p>\r\n<p>However, concerns have already been raised that the scheme could create a bubble by artificially pushing prices too high.

This was a case involving a solicitor but the same principles apply to most other professional bodies.', '<p style="text-align: justify;">The lawyer in this case qualified overseas and later sought admission as a solicitor in the UK, having undertaken the qualified lawyers transfer test ( QLTT).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The form for the QLTT required details of any conviction or caution for any motoring offence resulting in disqualification; the answer given was &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact he had been apprehended by the police during 2006 when he was studying in the UK for a Masters Degree in financial law. He received a caution and a fine and disqualification for driving a friend&rsquo;s car without permission and without valid insurance. Upon the application for Admission to the Roll of Solicitors he was obliged to submit a CRB certificate which revealed the caution. He also specified on the application form that he had previously disclosed the caution.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He was asked to explain why he did not reveal the caution at the time and his response was that he thought that he had disclosed it. It was determined by the caseworker at this stage in the process that he was not a fit and proper person to be admitted to the roll of solicitors. He went on to challenge that decision arguing via lengthy submissions that he had not disclosed the caution due to &ldquo; compelling circumstances at the time&rdquo;. The adjudicator did not find that this amounted to a proper explanation and again refused to find him fit to be admitted.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The solicitor appealed the adjudicator&rsquo;s decision and provided an explanation that he had not disclosed the caution due to his misunderstanding and interpretation of the question on the form at the time. The appeal committee determined that the question on the form was clear and unambiguous and the decision to deny him admission was not unlawful. It was difficult to understand how he could have misunderstood it.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He appealed the decision to the Administrative Court. He based the application partly on the fact that he posed no risk to the public and that the decision was unlawful and also a breach of his Article 6 and 8 rights under the ECHR.

He had been given ample opportunity to answer the concerns raised by the regulatory body and had not done so.

(228, 'Unlawful practice of Dentistry- beware!', 'Case: [2013] All ER (D) 84 (Jun) 10th May 2013\r\n\r\n', '<p style="text-align: justify;">This is another example of a successful prosecution in the context of tooth whitening. It provides guidance on the determination of whether tooth whitening treatment comes within the meaning of the practice of Dentistry pursuant to s 37 of the Dentists Act 1984. Only those persons who have successfully registered with the General Dental Council, can practice dentistry such as dentists, clinical dental technicians, dental nurses and dental hygienists to name but a few.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The individual was prosecuted in the magistrates&rsquo; court facing a count of unlawfully practising dentistry and unlawfully carrying out the business of dentistry. She had a qualification from a beauty school and was insured to carry out tooth whitening providing treatments which complied with UK and EU law. The investigation arose out of a complaint made by a client who had been dissatisfied with the treatment.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The case highlighted the fact that it is common ground that tooth whitening is a treatment. What was disputed was whether and to what extent it was &ldquo;usually performed by dentists&rdquo;. The Council produced expert evidence which provided that tooth whitening was a treatment ordinarily or usually performed by a dentist and also relied on GDC guidance. In the Magistrates&rsquo; Court, the District Judge ruled that the expert evidence was only capable of proving that the treatment in respect of tooth whitening <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ought to be considered to be the</span> practice of dentistry. Against this Ms Jamous argued that even if the evidence proved that the practice was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">usually given by dentists</span> it was not sufficient to prove that it was usually given by dentists <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the context of s37</span>.&nbsp; She argued that unless it could be shown that the treatment was&nbsp; a specialist treatment, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">peculiar to dentists</span> it could not be held that it fell within the definition of the practice of dentistry. She argued that as anyone could purchase the product used by her and treat themselves or a friend as it is freely available to buy and regularly used by those who were not dentists, it was therefore not the practice of dentistry.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;The prosecution failed.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The GDC appealed by way of case stated. On appeal the court found that it was necessary and incumbent upon the District Judge to have been sure that the necessary facts had been proved.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It was held that the guidance relied upon by the Council was general guidance issued in order to regulate the profession of dentistry rather than to define the nature and type of work undertaken by a dentist. It could refer to treatments which viewed in isolation could not be regarded as describing the practice of dentistry. The guidance did not however, determine the scope of s 37.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The case makes it clear that the precise circumstances in which a treatment is given must fall to be considered&nbsp; together with appropriate expert evidence and any other relevant guidance. Whether a treatment falls within the definition of the practice of dentistry will depend on whether it is usually given by dentists and upon the factual circumstances as a whole in which it was given. In this case taking all of these into consideration, it was determined that it was the practice of dentistry and was therefore proscribed by section 38 and 40 of the Act. The case has been sent back to the Magistrates&rsquo; Court for sentence.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Section 37 determines the scope of a profession and those eligible to practise within that profession. This is to enable the proper supervision training discipline of that profession and is necessary for patient safety and protection of the public. The products associated with tooth whitening can be harmful if not applied properly or in the appropriate quantities. The court therefore rejected the argument that there were people applying the products themselves in the context of their own homes and were unqualified and unregulated . The public require protection from those who seek to provide a treatment to others, including where payment is made for the same where they are not qualified and unregulated. The issue that is also relevant here is not whether dentists historically provided the treatments but whether the evidence establishes that they usually performed the treatment in question.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are facing a prosecution by the CPS or the GDC or an investigation into suspected illegal practice call today....</p>', '2013-07-03', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', '2013-07-03 10:35:44', '2013-07-03 10:35:44', 2, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

If that were upheld nothing could be done and Number 31 would keep the land.</p>\r\n<p>However in the case, Parshall v Hackney, the judges decided that both parties had a valid registered title and therefore Number 31 never had adverse possession in the first place, and so couldn&rsquo;t claim ownership on that basis.

In London asking prices have soared by 12% annually to reach &pound;515,379 on average.</p>\r\n<p>The West Midlands and the North saw the smallest year-on-year rises, of 1% and 1.2% respectively. Meanwhile, asking prices are up 2.4% year-on-year in Wales. The latest study will fuel concerns that Government efforts to kick-start the housing market could lead to a "property bubble", with mortgage borrowers trying to stretch their finances too far. Sellers'' asking prices have risen every month this year. Rightmove, whose records go back to 2002, said it is doubling its forecast for house price increases over this year from 2% to 4%. Several other experts have also revised their predictions upwards amid signs that Government schemes to boost market activity are having an impact.</p>\r\n<p>It expects London to continue to out-perform the rest of the country and the South East to maintain its "strong momentum", driven by an on-going shortage of homes for sale which has the effect of strengthening competition among buyers. However, northern regions may struggle to maintain increases over the course of the year, it said.</p>\r\n<p>The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) reported last week that first-time buyer numbers have reached their highest in five-and-a-half years and a recent Halifax study found that one in four people expect house prices to lift by at least 5% over the next year.&nbsp; Rightmove''s own consumer confidence survey found that almost two-thirds of people expect prices to be higher in a year''s time, which is double the 31% who said this a year ago. <br />Miles Shipside, director of Rightmove, said: "Consumer confidence is key to the housing market and on this front there has finally been a year of minimal bad news, with a reasonable amount of good, after four years of pretty consistent doom and gloom.&nbsp; "Confidence and the ability to take on a long-term mortgage commitment give more buyers the spur to enter the market or trade up."</p>\r\n<p>Mortgage availability has sharply increased since the Government launched the Funding for Lending scheme last August This gives lenders access to cheap finance to help borrowers. Concerns have been raised about the potential impact on house prices of the new Help to Buy scheme, which from next year will enable lenders to use Government-backed guarantees to offer &pound;130 billion of low-deposit mortgages on new and existing properties.</p>\r\n<p>First 0% Mortgage Is Launched</p>\r\n<p>The price war in the mortgage market has stepped up a pace, with Leeds Building Society becoming the first lender to offer a 0% mortgage deal. Such "introductory" interest-free deals have become common place in the credit card market for years. But mortgage lenders appear to be following suit, with banks and building societies benefiting from record low interest rates, and cheap Government funding - designed to stimulate the housing market. Leeds Building Society has launched two new fixed-rate mortgage deals, both of which offer homeowners the option of paying no interest at all for the first six months. However, borrowers should tread carefully. Although this will reduce mortgage payments initially they will then pay a slightly higher rate for the remainder of the term. The exact rate will depend on how long you take the interest-free deal for, and the size of your deposit. Customers who have just a 10% deposit and who want to take the full six-month interest-free option, will pay a rate of 5.22% on the three-year deal for the remainder of the term. A spokesman for the Leeds Building Society said customers would not penalised for taking up the interest-free offer and would pay the same interest in total over the term. Rates start from 3.79% for the three years deal and 4.23% for the five-year deal, though both assume homeowners can put down a 20% deposit. Both mortgages have just a small arrangement fee of &pound;199.

Gross mortgage lending in June was up 2% on the previous month, and 26% higher than June 2012, the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said.', '<p>The total of &pound;14.7bn was the highest level of lending since October 2008. However, Bank of England figures show the rise in borrowing has not been mirrored among small businesses.</p>\r\n<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Price forecasts</span>. The pick-up in mortgage lending has been in evidence during the spring and summer months. Gross lending for the second quarter of the year reached an estimated &pound;42bn, the CML said. This was up 24% on the previous three months, and the highest level since the end of 2008.</p>\r\n<p>"Improvements in the cost and availability of mortgage credit are underpinning a meaningful recovery in the housing market," said CML chief economist Bob Pannell. "Current positive trends are set to continue for the immediate future."</p>\r\n<p>However, Mr Pannell pointed out that the increased activity did not mark a return to a housing boom similar to that seen in the last decade. "Although the underlying pace of first-time buyer activity is approaching a quarter of a million per year, it is worth bearing in mind that this is still barely half of activity rates a decade earlier, and so far below what might be considered normal levels," he said.</p>\r\n<p>This view was echoed by analysts, who said that that economic climate was putting the brakes on a runaway market. While the lending numbers are the strongest they have been since 2008, this will be a long, slow recovery. Much ground has been lost and lending levels are running at a fraction of what they were at the height of the housing boom.</p>\r\n<p>Government schemes such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy have put some life in the housing market.

It believes that property values will increase by 3.5% this year, compared with its previous forecast of no change, and will go up by 4.5% next year, instead of a predicted 1.5% rise. Their longer term prediction is that UK house prices should rise by an average of 18.1 per cent by the end of 2017.</p>\r\n<p>"A combination of low interest rates and stimulus measures means there is capacity for improved price growth over the next three years or so," said Lucian Cook, director of Savills residential research.

It forecasts that 3.7 million <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/youngpeople">young people</a> will be living with their parents by 2020, as the rate of housebuilding fails to keep up with the rising population.</p>\r\n<p>The report claims that by 2020 the price of a first-time buyer''s home will increase by 42% to &pound;245,165; whilst wages for 22- to 29-year-olds are predicted to increase by 36% by 2020. The report fears that this poses a huge challenge for those wishing to be homeowners. &ldquo;Low-earning young people would have to spend 16 times their average wage just to buy a home".</p>\r\n<p>Rents will be driven even higher as young adults are priced out of the property market. "NHF research shows that private rents are likely to be broadly stable through 2013, but could increase sharply, by about 6% a year, between 2015 and 2020 as interest rates and house prices rise.

Some of the members of that group had been violent in some demonstrations but C had never been involved in any such criminal behaviour. Nevertheless information was held and stored on a database, the National Domestic Extremism database which was established and used by the Association of Chief Polce Officers. The database has no statutory foundation but was formed out of the general common law powers of the police to gather and manage information and make the same available to assist in their dissemination of intelligence. The database can be accessed by other forces to assist in the prevention of crime and the maintenance of public order.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The information concerning C that had been gathered related to his name, &nbsp;age, appearance and his history of attending demonstrations. What is also key here is the fact that it was the intention of the police to store the information either until the group ceased to function or indefinitely. C therefore sought an order for judicial review and an order that all information relating to him be removed from the database as it represented an breach of his right to privacy under Article 8 ECHR and Sch 1 of the Human Rights Act 1998. His application was refused and he appealed.</p>\r\n<p>The court held that in relation to the collection and retention of personal data by public authorities a factor of particular importance was whether the data had been subjected to systematic processing and entry on a database capable of being searched in a way that enabled the authorities to recover information by reference to a particular person. The information about C held on the database was information falling within the scope of his personal autonomy over which he was entitled to retain control. It did not follow from the fact that the public could expect the police to gather and process intelligence relating to violent protest movements that C''s art 8 rights were not engaged. C was not thought to have been engaged in criminality of any kind and the records of his attendance at demonstrations were to be retained indefinitely. Accordingly, although he was not the specific object of any of the reports, the inclusion of personal information relating to C on the database had involved an interference with his right to respect for private life which required justification. The information held on C was of a very limited nature merely the fact of his attendance at protests; nothing suggested that that he had done anything beyond lend his general support by his presence. The information appeared unlikely to provide any assistance in relation to intelligence gathering. Accordingly, the respondent had not shown that the value of the information was sufficient in order to justify its continued retention. The interference with C''s art 8 rights was therefore not proportionate. C''s appeal would be allowed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case was heard at the same time as the case of T. The facts in that case were that T had been served with a ''Prevention of Harassment Letter'' by the police after an allegation made by a neighbour of a single incident of insulting behaviour. The police had attempted to visit T the day after the alleged incident but had been unable to speak to her. They had therefore decided to serve her with the letter and tried without success to do so on a number of subsequent visits. &nbsp;The Crime Recording Information System (CRIS) recorded the fact that a decision had been taken to serve T with a warning letter and the steps taken to do so. The police policy was to retain police information letters and CRIS reports relating to single allegations of conduct of a kind, which if repeated, could constitute harassment, for a period of 12 years. T considered that she had been treated unfairly by being given no opportunity to respond to the allegation. She went on to apply for judicial review and sought an order that the police destroy their copy of the letter and remove from CRIS all references to the letter and the decision to issue it. Her application was unsuccessful. The judge found that the interference with her art 8 rights was justified under art 8(2) as being in accordance with the law and necessary in the interests of public safety for the prevention of or crime or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\nOn appeal, however, the court took a different view. They found that the information was of itself of the personal kind. Any systematic processing and retention of it therefore had to be justified or otherwise it represents an interference with right to privacy. Even if the information was considered initially as public in nature, it was also likely over the course of time to be forgotten about, especially if never repeated and as such would become a private matter. The failure of the police to speak to T before serving her with the warning letter did not render the whole procedure disproportionate, but the retention of the letter or the CRIS report for more than a matter of months needed to be justified by evidence. The commissioner of police had concluded for the purposes of the instant appeal that, some two-and-a-half years after the event, he was content for the record to be expunged on the grounds that there had been no ongoing concerns regarding risk and no reports of any further incidents. It was therefore clear that the continued retention of the information would have been unnecessary, disproportionate and unjustifiable and the appeal was successful', '2013-08-07', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', '2013-08-07 14:23:36', '2013-08-07 14:23:36', 2, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

The average price is now up nearly 4% on July last year and has leapt 12%from the low point of the recession.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Robert Gardner, Nationwide chief economist, said Government schemes such as Help to Buy and Funding for Lending, designed to make it easier and cheaper to borrow, were "boosting demand". He warned the chronic shortage of homes being built was adding to the upwards pressure. He said: "The pick up in price is fairly gradual at this stage but mortgage availability is improving and cost of credit is low." Experts said while the rising property market was good news for homeowners, the Government risked creating another bubble of artificially high prices similar to before the credit crisis. Ross Walker, UK economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, said:" There is a risk we recreate past mistakes. If all the Government is trying to do is give a little nudge then the effects will be largely minimal. But if they''re saying ''interest rates will be at record lows for some time and borrow as much as you can'', well, that sounds very familiar."</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Business secretary Vince Cable voiced fears of another housing bubble last weekend, warning the next phase of the Chancellor''s &pound;130 billion Help to Buy scheme, mortgage guarantees on house purchases up to &pound;600,000, could "inflate the market".</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said: "We mustn''t risk returning to the problems of the last decade when housing got out of control." &nbsp;Two of Britain''s biggest banks cut mortgage rates this week in a bid to catch more of the market. Halifax cut its rates on a two-year fixed by 0.2% to 3.79% for those with a 15% deposit, and offered &pound;500 towards a TV or broadband package as part of the new campaign.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">HSBC launched its "lowest ever" mortgage, 1.49%for a two-year fix for borrowers with a 40% deposit.

That is the clear indication from the first major poll of buy-to-let investors since the April welfare reforms.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Such news may bring a hearty cheer from cash-strapped tenants but there is a sting in the tail. &nbsp;In March, 34% of landlords were taking money from tenants on housing benefit. But the Government''s new benefit cap has worried many, to the extent that four months later only 27% were still accepting such tenants, according to the National Landlords Association (NLA). A return, perhaps, to the awful "no DHSS" warning added to a generation ago. Under changes made in April, the amount of benefit was capped at &pound;500 per week for families with children and &pound;350 per week for individuals. This means that landlords may find some tenants, especially those with larger families, will no longer have enough housing benefit available to cover the rent.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A second change also has landlords worried.&nbsp; Benefits will all be paid under a single monthly payment of Universal Credit. This has already happened in some areas and will cover everywhere by 2017. Housing benefit will also be paid within this payment, going directly to the recipient rather than to the landlord, as often happens now.&nbsp; Landlords are worried that they will need to work harder to get their rent.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">At the start of last year, most people under the age of 35 were told they would now only be entitled to housing benefit at the "shared accommodation rate". In other words, they can receive what it would cost for a bedsit. This, of course, has pumped-up demand for such property and spawned another property investing opportunity. It''s known as HMO &ndash; house in multiple occupancy &ndash; and lots of investors are getting in on the act.</p>', '2013-08-08', '42_SELLARS_MARKET_header.JPG', 'image/jpeg', 100374, '2013-08-08 15:10:01', '', '2013-08-08 15:10:02', '2013-08-08 15:17:05', 2, 2, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

He was ordered to be struck off the Roll. An order for costs was also made against him in the sum of &pound;28000 not to be enforced without leave of the Court. He appealed. On appeal he was unsuccessful in respect of the order for strike off. The SRA applied for a costs order against the Solicitor in the sum of &pound;28000. The court heard evidence as to the means of the solicitor and received a written statement as regards the same. The court summarily assessed the costs in the sum of &pound;20,000 and made an order in that sum, such order not to be enforced without leave of the court. The SRA then sought an order for costs in respect of the Appeal in the sum of &pound;22,000. The appellant did not challenge an order for costs being made against him, it was however submitted that the amount of costs should be less and that any order should not be enforced without leave of the High Court.

However, it was submitted that the instant proceedings were not ordinary civil proceedings but were ones brought by a professional regulator for the purposes of maintaining public confidence in the integrity of the profession.

The second is that it cannot be right for an impecunious solicitor to be pursued in respect of significant sums in costs where they clearly do not have the means to pay. Such was the case here. The solicitor had effectively no income and had lost his right to earn a living as a solicitor. He had funded the costs himself defending the proceedings and had exhausted his assets.

In July 2002 she examined a patient who had been complaining of problems in his right eye. He later went to hospital and was diagnosed with retinal detachment, which subsequently required surgery. The appellant was charged with serious professional misconduct in relation to her consultation with the patient, in that she (i) failed to examine the right eye correctly, because she (a) did not dilate the pupil, (b) did not examine the fundus adequately and (c) did not carry out a visual field test, and (ii) that she failed to record her examination correctly. According to the GOC, she had conducted a cursory examination of the patient, gave an untrue excuse for omitting to dilate his eye and that the patient, not the appellant, had mentioned the possibility of retinal detachment. Her recording of the examination was wholly inadequate.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The optician maintained that her examination was sufficient for her to appreciate the risk of retinal detachment, and that she had acted correctly by refering him to the hospital.

The committee drafted reasons for its decision in July 2004, and provided them to the appellant in the next month.

In the instant case, the findings of misconduct by the committee could not stand with its findings of fact.<br />The reasons in the instant case were of a disappointing standard, as they left undetermined important issues of fact. It was crucial to the gravity of the appellant&rsquo;s misconduct whether she had referred the patient at her own instigation, rather than at the patient&rsquo;s insistence, and whether she informed the doctor that the patient might have had a retinal detachment. It was unfortunate that neither of those issues was addressed in the particulars of the charge, as they should have been. The committee&rsquo;s reasons had to be interpreted most favourably to the appellant. So doing, the facts found constituted an isolated incident and did not justify the finding of serious professional misconduct. <br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is much to be said for legal assessors to disciplinary committees being provided with a standard direction on professional misconduct, in the same way that standard directions, formulated by the judicial studies board, are available for judges and juries in criminal cases.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '2013-08-12', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', '2013-08-12 11:18:36', '2013-08-12 11:18:36', 2, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

Correctly, in my view, he recognised that the Committee was tasked to make a discretionary decision, having regard to all of the factors identified in the authorities to which the Committee''s attention was drawn.</p>\r\n<p class="loose">I have set out the circumstances, touching upon the Appellant''s medical condition, as they were described to the Committee. It is apparent, in my judgment, that there was no proper diagnosis, nor was there any real suggestion of when the Appellant might attend. Importantly, there was no explicit indication that the Appellant was unfit to attend, despite that very question having been asked in the email sent to Dr Toosey from which I have read.</p>\r\n<p class="loose">Following consideration of those emails, and having listened to the legal advisor who correctly summarised the legal position, the Committee retired to consider the matter at 3pm. It is worth noting that the care with which the Committee approached this question of adjournment is reflected in the fact that they started the hearing at 9.40am and had adjourned in and out of both open and private hearings to enable Mr Graham to illuminate further the medical position. They returned after just short of 20 minutes and refused the adjournment.</p>\r\n<p class="loose">In the reasons which the Committee gave, which came later, the chairman again referred to R v Jones. In concluding that there should be no adjournment, the Committee noted that the material from the doctor did not state that the Appellant was unfit to attend. The Committee balanced the interests of the Appellant with the interests of the witness, who had now attended twice, and questions of fairness to the Council. It also had regard to the public interest. In my judgment, there is no proper basis upon which this decision of the Committee, namely not to adjourn, can be impugned. In the circumstances faced by the Committee, it was entitled to reject the application for an adjournment.&rdquo;</p>', '2013-08-12', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', '2013-08-12 11:20:48', '2013-08-12 11:20:48', 2, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

He represented himself at the hearing.</p>\r\n<p>The Panel followed the three stage approach to be adopted in fitness to practise proceedings. At the initial fact finding stage the factual basis of the allegations was considered and as a result of his admission were found proved. At the second stage, as regards the issue of impairment, the NMC sought to refer to the registrant&rsquo;s previous conviction for drink driving some several years earlier. The nurse did not object to the adducing of that evidence but on the second day of the hearing sought an adjournment of the hearing. He wished to seek a report from a psychiatrist to show that he was no longer alcohol dependent. That application was refused both on the basis that it was made very late in the day and also that the NMC did not deny that he was no longer alcohol dependent.</p>\r\n<p>The Panel went on to determine impairment and found it established. The Panel referred in particular to the fact that the conviction for assault was particularly serious as it had taken place on hospital premises and involved an assault on a member of staff.</p>\r\n<p>The conduct was serious and tended to damage the reputation of the profession. The nurse had not demonstrated sufficient insight particularly with regard to the potential impact of his behaviour of the public and there was a sufficient potential of harm to patients as a result of his current impairment of fitness to practise.</p>\r\n<p>At sanction stage, the Panel considered both the fact he had previously been subject to a regime of conditions of practise.

He was made subject to an erasure sanction.</p>\r\n<p>The nurse appealed.

The TaxPayers'' Alliance, which is campaigning for reform to the hated duty, said four out of every five homes sold in 2012/13 in England and Wales will be subject to the stamp duty land tax within five years. It warned that 40% of homes sold by this time will be subject to stamp duty of 3% or more, leaving buyers with a bill of £7,500 or more. Currently, a quarter of all house sales across England and Wales attract the higher 3% rate of stamp duty – originally intended for only the most expensive properties. \r\n', '<p>The TaxPayers'' Alliance claimed 99% of homes in London will be liable for stamp duty in five years'' time and in the North West this figure will be three in five. It predicts that here in the East Midlands we will see the fastest increase in the number of homes liable for stamp duty, from around half to just over seven in ten by 2018. Its findings are based on property price growth forecasts over the next five years by Savills Research.</p>\r\n<p>The TaxPayers'' Alliance recently launched a Stamp out Stamp Duty campaign calling for a cut in the levy, which raised &pound;4bn for the Treasury in 2012/13. Sales of homes are free of stamp duty up to the value of &pound;125,000 and attract a 1% tax above this level and up to &pound;250,000. But rising house prices as the housing market gathers pace mean that more purchasers face paying at the higher rates of 3% applied to homes worth over &pound;250,000 to &pound;500,000, 4% on those valued at over &pound;500,000 up to &pound;1m, 5% on those over &pound;1m to &pound;2m and 7% beyond that point. Three in 10 homes will have moved up into another stamp duty bracket in five year''s time, the report predicted.</p>\r\n<p>The findings come at a time when the housing market has been showing a strong pick-up in activity, following Government schemes such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy, which have made it easier to get access to a mortgage.</p>\r\n<p>Lenders have been reporting a surge in first-time buyers flooding back into the market, which has helped to free up some housing chains. The strengthened demand, at a time when the volume of houses for sale on the market is still in relatively short supply, has led to a stronger-than-expected rise in house prices this year so far.</p>\r\n<p>Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers'' Alliance, said: "As the property market recovers, more and more people will be sucked into paying punitive rates of stamp duty and it will be more expensive to move than ever. "High stamp duty rates stop young people buying a home and starting a family, discourage elderly people from downsizing and make it harder to move to a new place for a new job.

These contracts do not oblige the employer to provide work for the employee, or for the employee to accept the work offered.</p>\r\n<p>Zero-hours contracts can be an attractive option for some employers in today&rsquo;s economic climate and, managed correctly, can be appealing to both workers and employers because of their flexibility.</p>\r\n<p>Zero hours contracts provide workers with certain employment rights, such as paid holiday and redundancy rights, which do not apply to casual workers.

The result is a “contagious” confidence in the housing market, which will have a knock-on effect for the wider economy, according to industry experts. \r\n\r\nThe latest evidence of Britain’s economic recovery comes days after forecasts for the country’s annual economic growth were doubled from 0.8 to 1.5%.

Economic confidence is returning, pushing many more buyers in the direction of property, and persuading lenders to offer more loans to buyers with smaller deposits.</p>\r\n<p>The recovery in the property market has also eroded negative equity, giving banks greater confidence to lend.

This improvement in the market has meant more homeowners struggling with their mortgages have been able to sell up without having to worry about negative equity. In cases where the worst has happened and homes have been repossessed, an improvement in the housing market means banks are able to achieve better prices on repossessions sales.</p>\r\n<p>The Government&rsquo;s efforts to support the property market include last year&rsquo;s Funding for Lending scheme, which made &pound;80 billion available to banks for loans, the vast majority of which has gone to mortgage lending.

The scheme will be widened beyond new-build properties in January and will also be available to people moving up the property ladder.</p>\r\n<p>There are, however, critics of the scheme, including the International Monetary Fund, which has warned it could create a new house price bubble.</p>\r\n<p>Buyers have also been warned not to over-stretch themselves, as house prices remain high against average wages and interest rates will eventually rise. New borrowers need to ensure that they can afford interest rate rises as current low interest rates won&rsquo;t be around forever.

In August, the ONS''s house price index stood at 185.8, surpassing its previous peak of 185.5 in January 2008. The average price of a house or flat in the UK is now &pound;247,000, the ONS said, the highest figure since the index was first calculated in 1968. The figures suggest house prices are rising in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but still falling in Scotland.</span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The latest figures will fuel the debate on whether a house price bubble is developing. UK prices </span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">are now above their previous peak in January 2008, according to the ONS. However, once again big variations around the UK have been revealed. London price rises in the year to August, at 8.7%, were more than double the next biggest increase of 3.8% here in the East Midlands. </span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Both were well ahead of increases of around 1% in Wales and Northern Ireland and a fall in Scotland. </span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">There is clearly not a UK-wide boom, but the fact that first-time buyers are paying nearly 5% more on average will give ammunition to those who feel affordability is the key issue, rather than mortgage availability, which is the focus of the chancellor''s new Help to Buy initiative.</span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Prices across the UK rose by 3.8% in the year to August 2013, up from 3.3% in July. However, excluding London and the South East - where property values have seen the biggest increases - prices rose by just 2.1%.</span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Other measures, including surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide, indicate that house prices are still well below record levels. Earlier this month, the Halifax reported that the average price of a house was &pound;170,733, nearly &pound;30,000 short of the peak seen in July 2007. The difference in average prices is due to the different methodology used by the ONS. The ONS index is calculated on actual transaction prices, whereas the Halifax and Nationwide use mortgage approvals.

Monthly figures for the same period show prices up 0.6 per cent annually at an average of &pound;162,169. House prices are rising at their fastest rate for three years, Nationwide has reported, as it posted annual inflation of 5.8 per cent.<br />The Nationwide figures followed the Land Registry''s verdict. It said house prices jumped almost &pound;2,500 in September as sold values in England and Wales rose 1.5 per cent over the month, in further evidence that a fresh burst of confidence is taking hold of home buyers and sellers.</p>\r\n<p><br />But while there are fears of a new bubble being blown, property transactions remain a third down on the level seen in 2007 before the financial crisis hit and prices are up by only 3.4 per cent annually.&nbsp; The average home has risen by &pound;5,532 over the past year to &pound;167,063, the Land Registry says.</p>\r\n<p>House prices are rising in all but one region annually, with inflation ranging from the North West&rsquo;s modest 0.6 per cent increase to homes rocketing 9.3 per cent in London.&nbsp; The capital&rsquo;s growth continues to dwarf all other areas, running at more than double the pace of even the neighbouring South East, where prices are up 4.4 per cent annually. The only faller was Wales, where prices dropped 1.7 per cent.</p>\r\n<p>The Land Registry figures arrived on the heels of a Hometrack report, which said house prices rose by 0.5 per cent in October and 3.1 per cent annually.<br />It highlighted that sellers were achieving 95.2 per cent of their asking price, second only to the figure of 95.7 per cent seen at the height of the 2007 property boom.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Are these really signs of a new bubble?</strong></p>\r\n<strong></strong>\r\n<p><br />One flaw in the bubble case is that property transaction figures are also released by the Land Registry and show that while the market may be picking up, sales are still far below pre-crash levels. Separate figures from the Land Registry report detail average monthly transactions in the three months to July at 62,034, up 16 per cent on the 53,698 a year earlier, but they have a long way to go to get anywhere near long-term average levels.<br />Of course, they may not get back there and house prices could still continue to rise too fast. <br />The other point to highlight is that while there can be little doubt that much of London and the South East are sat firmly in bubble territory, much of the rest of Britain''s heavily localised property markets remain flat.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Are rising house prices a good thing?</strong></p>\r\n<p><br />The property market has become the cornerstone of the British economy, so in the short-term rising prices spell good news.<br />Property in London and the popular commuter belt has been on full steam ahead for some time after recovering from the post credit crunch slump, but much of the rest of the country has been stuck in the doldrums.<br />With wages stagnant and many stuck with low levels of equity or in negative equity, this has left people unable to move and sapped confidence. Those who have been stuck in this position will welcome a pick-up in prices.<br />In the short term a revival is good for the economy. People moving home tend to spend money, on anything from new household goods to party food, and rising house prices generally equate to greater confidence.<br />Looked at over the longer term, however, a return to above inflation property price rises is likely to cause the economy more problems. Prices are still historically high compared to wages and homes are only affordable due to record low mortgage rates, which one day must rise.<br />The props under the market in Funding for Lending and Help to Buy have a common aim, making expensive property more affordable through easier credit.

Increased confidence will no doubt produce extraordinary price rises. Regional disparities that exist will continue to play out, and may well be exaggerated further by the Government&rsquo;s blanket implementation of Help to Buy.

That would be 3.5 times the average in Northern Ireland and 3.3 times the average in the north-east of England.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The report said international interest in London property had been "very high due to a combination of heightened risk elsewhere in the world, low returns on other assets such as bonds, equities and cash, and a weak pound, which has made London properties cheaper for foreigner buyers".</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The report added: "Arguably it would be more appropriate to treat it as an investment market, rather than a residential market."</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ernst &amp; Young''s head of real estate, Dean Hodcroft, said London is now so popular with the super-rich that it would be hard for policymakers to intervene and cool the market. He said: "Bursting a bubble at the luxury end of the market, which continues to attract interest from international cash buyers with the seemingly irresistible global draw of London''s X-factor, may prove tricky."</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Item Club report said the Bank of England should consider intervening to block people from being able to borrow more than three times their income. "If multiples began to approach this level we would regard this as a sign that borrowers and lenders were throwing caution to the wind and that the market was entering bubble territory." The average mortgage in London is already more than three times average salary.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The housing minister, Kris Hopkins, said: "The London housing market has received valuable support from foreign investment, unlocking development and leading to the building of homes that wouldn''t otherwise happen."</p>', '2014-02-06', '42_SELLARS_MARKET_header.JPG', 'image/jpeg', 100374, '2014-02-06 16:05:58', '', '2014-02-06 16:05:58', '2014-02-06 16:05:58', 2, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

However, he said "continuing pressures on household finances, as earnings fail to keep pace with consumer price inflation, are expected to remain a constraint on the rate of growth of house prices".</p>\r\n<p>Confidence among buyers is high with regards to their ability to get mortgage finance and their belief that house prices will continue to rise so they need to move sooner rather than later. Lenders were keen to offer loans ahead of the introduction of new rules in April, which will mean they have to carry out tougher affordability checks on applicants. With the Mortgage Market Review set to be introduced at the end of April, this will likely lead to a slowdown in lending as lenders get to grip with the changes they need to introduce. Lenders are therefore trying to get ahead of the game, so now is a good time to secure a competitive deal.</p>\r\n<p>On Wednesday last week, the Halifax announced it had offered 1,000 mortgages through the second phase of the government''s Help to Buy scheme since its launch in October.</p>\r\n<p>It said eight in 10 of the 5,000 applications it had received so far were from outside London and the south-east, and a similar proportion were from first-time buyers.</p>\r\n<p>HSBC''s research on what it termed "property haves and have-nots" aged between 25 and 36 suggested that despite schemes like Help to Buy, those who were not yet homeowners were expecting to reach 35 before they were able to afford to buy.</p>\r\n<p>At this stage those who were already on the ladder were likely to be trading up to a family home, it said. Those who had bought would be able to clear their mortgage by 60, while property have-nots would only pay it off at 67.</p>\r\n<p>Of those who had bought, two-thirds had help from their parents, and the fact they would clear their mortgage at a younger age would allow them to help their children do the same later.

The price jump sparked calls for the government to cancel its Help to Buy scheme, which critics argue has artificially inflated prices and encouraged speculation in London and the south-east.\r\nRob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg bank, said: "I think the housing market is doing fine without Help to Buy.

Most of the concerns centre on the charging thresholds, which were set years ago and have not taken price inflation into account.</p>\r\n<p><br />Nationwide Building Society is calling for a &ldquo;more proportionate system&rdquo;. Chief executive Graham Beale says: &ldquo;This would overcome the distortions created in the housing market. It would offer help not just to the many first-time buyers but to families seeking larger homes to fit their changing circumstances.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><br />The National Association of Estate Agents (NAEA) is also calling on the Government to address what it dubs the &ldquo;unfair and hugely expensive stamp duty slab structure&rdquo;.

Over the same period shares would have earned investors 6.8% a year, bonds 6.5% and savings in the bank 4%.

(305, 'What The New Mortgage Rules Mean To You', 'A mortgage is usually the biggest debt that people face during their lives. Now the rules governing who can secure a home loan have tightened. The new system, which came into force fully on 26 April 2014, ensures that lenders conduct a full affordability check on mortgage applicants.\r\n\r\nThis will have practical implications for the amount people can borrow and the length of time that an application might take.\r\nThe aim is to prevent any return of the pre-crisis mortgage lending that many described as "reckless".\r\n', '<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the financial crisis, the housing market was booming, sales were frequent, and lenders were keen to advance individuals a mortgage. In some cases, potential buyers were able to borrow the full price of a home, and a loan on top, then initially just pay back the interest.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When property prices fell, many found themselves in negative equity. Many who lost their jobs or had hours reduced also found they had overextended themselves when borrowing for a mortgage and struggled to make repayments.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has introduced new regulations to ensure the most extreme cases are not repeated.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">"In the past too many people got a mortgage by simply telling their lender they would have no problem repaying their debt, and that was that," said Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the FCA. "Our new rules will hardwire common sense into mortgage lending."</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, there are concerns about the implementation. A stricter interview could mean lenders ask more delving questions about an applicant''s lifestyle and the whole process could take longer. That could extend the amount of time it takes to move home. Some people could find that they might have been able to get a mortgage previously, but now discover that the lender is only prepared to offer a smaller amount, or may reject the application completely. This will not only affect first-time buyers, but also those looking to remortgage.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One reason for this is that a lender has to "stress test"; a customer''s ability to repay if interest rates were to rise. The Bank rate is at a record low at the moment, so mortgage rates have also been low for some time. A lender, who might be offering a mortgage with an interest rate of less than 4% now, will have to decide whether an applicant would be able to make regular repayments if the rate rose to something like 7%.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to decide, the lender will not only take account of income, but of outgoings too.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What questions could you be asked? </strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The lender is interested in how much money is spare in a borrower''s personal budget. So any regular payments could be asked about in the application process. This could range from the cost of regular haircuts, gambling and club subscriptions and deliveries, to holidays, travel season tickets and childcare.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Borrowers will also be expected to say if their financial position is expected to change. That could include any predicted changes in income or working hours, but might also include any plans to have children in the near future.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Many lenders had already implemented the new rules, so borrowers might recognise some of these questions already. The Council of Mortgage Lenders says the transition to the new rules will be "smooth".</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What suggestions are being made to applicants? </strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Brokers say it will be important to have a household budget clearly worked out before starting the application process. They say that lenders are likely to ask for a number of documents that prove income and outgoings figures, such as payslips and bank statements. They say it is important to send all these documents together in one go when they are requested; otherwise the process could be delayed further.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some also suggest "cleaning up" a household budget.

HMRC reviewed nearly 260,000 estates in the 2010-2011 tax year, meaning inheritance tax was paid by only 6 per cent of estates, a figure similar to the two previous years.

While the number of employee jobs has only recently regained its pre-recession level, the number of people who are self-employed has grown by 650,000 since 2008 to reach 4.5 million, or nearly 15 per cent of all employment.\r\n', '<p>Analysis by the Resolution Foundation (RF &ndash; the UK &lsquo;Think Tank of the Year 2013&rsquo;) of national datasets and a new survey of just under 1,000 self-employed people, suggests that there is strong evidence of a significant structural element, but that there does also appear to be an important cyclical component contributing to recent self-employment growth.</p>\r\n<p>Alongside what this means for the economy, the RF has looked at how self-employed people are faring financially. The analysis finds that self-employed weekly earnings are 20 per cent lower than they were in 2006-07, while employee earnings have fallen by just 6 per cent. The drop has been seen across genders and industries but is particularly notable among people of prime earning age (35 to 50 years old) whose earnings are 26 per cent lower. As a result, the typical self-employed person now earns 40 per cent less than the typical employed person.</p>\r\n<p>The analysis paints a worrying picture of the security and vulnerability of self-employed people on both a short and long term horizon. Only 30 per cent of self-employed people are contributing to a pension, compared to 51 per cent of employees. The survey also indicates that a minority of self-employed people are experiencing difficulties getting mortgages, tenancies and accessing personal credit and loans, specifically due to being self-employed.</p>\r\n<p>If high levels of self-employment are set to be a permanent feature, it is crucial that this 15 per cent of the workforce are able to access basics such as housing and credit and have sufficient pensions and savings.

(310, 'The New ISAs or NISAs explained', 'The Chancellor’s March 2014 Budget may well go down as one of the most radically overhauling game-changers since Lloyd George ushered in the state pension in the 1908 Pensions Act (at the time perceived as dangerously radical).\r\nIt has completely levelled the playing field as far as alternatives to the old pensions system are concerned. In summary, you are no longer obliged to buy an annuity when your pension plan matures under the new measures.  Under the old regime, many savers invested in flexible ISAs instead of the rigidly constraining old pension schemes (ISAs allow savings to grow tax-free and can be cashed in any time).  The new measures improve ISAs even more: raising the limit that can be invested to £15,000 (from £11,520) and making it easier to transfer your savings between cash and stocks & shares.\r\nSo now that we all have the freedom to take all of our money on retirement to spend or re-invest as we wish, it is worth taking a closer look at the three key staging posts on the savings journey to help decide which is the best route to take.\r\n', '<p><strong>Staging Post 1: keeping up-to-date</strong></p>\r\n<p>From 1 July, year 2014/15, ISAs will automatically become N(ew)ISAs, enabling you to add further savings up to the new &pound;15,000 limit. You will be able to open one cash and one stocks &amp; shares NISA each tax year. Crucially, the whole &pound;15,000 allowance may be held in cash, stocks &amp; shares or any combination of the two.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Staging Post 2: investments growth cycle</strong></p>\r\n<p>Pensions: the one thing both pensions and ISAs offer is a wide range of cash and investment options. While you are paying into your pension it benefits from tax relief coupled with compound interest &ndash; which can significantly increase the size of your total pot at retirement, notably so if you are a higher-rate taxpayer paying 40% tax on your ordinary income which is matched by 40% tax relief on your pension payments.<br />ISAs: ISA savers&rsquo; deposit money has already been taxed so does not benefit from tax relief on payments at source, as with pensions. However the new regime means that for the first time you will be able to transfer funds from stocks &amp; shares into cash &ndash; previously, you could only move money from a cash ISA to a stocks &amp; shares ISA but not the other way around. With NISAs, the transfer of cash/stocks/shares &ndash; whatever sort of NISA it is &ndash; between providers will be unrestricted.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Staging Post 3: drawdown time</strong></p>\r\n<p>From April 2015, you can access your pension pot in its entirety at any time after the age of 55. The first 25% will remain tax-free, the remainder being taxed at marginal rates.</p>\r\n<p>Note: the minimum age for access is being raised to 57 in 2028 to keep pace with rises in the state pension age.</p>\r\n<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example</span>: From a &pound;100,000 pension you can take &pound;25,000 tax-free with the remaining &pound;75,000 available to spend / re-invest as you wish. However, the &pound;75,000 is treated as income for that tax year, pushing you into a higher-rate tax band.</p>\r\n<p>Alternatively, draw the money down in small(er) annual lump sums which attract taxation at the basic minimum rate, currently 20% each year. You could keep your money invested in the stock market and go into &lsquo;income drawdown&rsquo; &ndash; an attractive option if you were formerly a higher-rate tax payer benefitting from 40% tax relief on money paid into your plan.</p>\r\n<p>If you are after the security of a guaranteed income for life, of course you can still buy an annuity: these are predicted to improve as providers are forced to offer better terms in the face of dwindling customers.</p>\r\n<p>Even taking into consideration all the above, the attraction of the NISA still stands out.

Findings show savings pots have increased too, but the level of monthly expenditure has risen with the cost of living putting increased pressure on household budgets.\r\nAviva’s Spring 2014 Real Retirement Report assesses consumer finances across the UK’s three ages of retirement: pre-retirees (55-64 year olds) retiring (65-74 year olds) and the long-term retired (over-75 year olds).\r\n', '<p style="text-align: justify;">The research revealed growing income among over-55s with the age-group now typically receiving &pound;1,373 a month in income &ndash; an extra &pound;151 a month compared to the same time last year (Q1 2013).

Nearly a third (29%) named this as a source of income compared with 24% at the same time last year (Q1 2013) and 25% for the previous years (Q1 2012 and 2011).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Savings levels have also vastly improved as over-55s seek financial stability. More savers are now putting away more money to protect themselves against the rising cost of living and the fear of having enough money in retirement. The amount of money put away in savings and investments reached a high of &pound;18,632 in Q1 2014 &ndash; last reaching near these levels in Q3 2012 when they stood at &pound;17,750.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The 65-74 age group have the largest savings pots at &pound;25,938 compared with &pound;13,158 for the 55-64s and &pound;13,750 for the over 75s. On average, households are putting away &pound;198 a month in savings. A smaller proportion of over-55s than in previous years, do not have any savings but it is still significant at 28%. Monthly saving habits are also improving with those not saving anything down to 9% from a high of 15% in 2011.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The rising cost of living is biting into these savings however, with spending among the over-55s hitting an average of &pound;816 a month &ndash; a high point for the Real Retirement Report. Food, fuel and lighting, housing, motoring and entertaining, recreation and holidays are proving the most expensive of monthly purchases. Of these, all except housing (mortgages and rent) have increased on the same time last year (Q1 2013).</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The report also revealed that over-55s are now less reliant on borrowing. The level of unsecured debt owed by the over-55s has fallen across credit cards, loans and overdrafts in 2014. Credit card balances have been fluctuating over the years, yet have now fallen to an average of &pound;777 &ndash; which has been reducing over time. In total the over-55s owe an average of &pound;2,022 which is slightly higher than this time last year (Q1 2013) at &pound;1,910 but lower than &pound;2,166 in Q1 2012 and &pound;2,370 in Q1 2011.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Property unsurprisingly remains the largest asset for the majority of over-55s with 66% owning their own home outright and 17% owning their home but with an outstanding mortgage.

It has also come under fire for disproportionately affecting buyers and sellers in the South-east. There have been repeated calls to change the duty so that it is fairer. George Osborne said: "We are going to change fundamentally this antiaspirational homes tax that has distorted our market for decades."', '<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s how it works:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>The Old System:</strong> someone buying a home for &pound;125,000 paid no tax, while someone buying a property for &pound;125,001 paid 1 per cent (&pound;1,250). Those buying a property for &pound;250,000 had to pay 1 per cent in tax (&pound;2,500), while buying a property for &pound;250,001 would incur duty at 3 per cent (&pound;7,500) on the whole sum. Over &pound;500,000 it was 4%; over &pound;1m was 5% and over &pound;2m was 7%.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The New System:</strong> new reforms remove the "dead zones" just above each existing stamp duty band, and see a more progressive approach where buyers will be liable only for the portion of a property''s value above each new level.</p>\r\n<p>Under the new system, you will not pay tax on the first &pound;125,000 of a property''s value. You will then pay 2 per cent on the portion from &pound;125,000 to &pound;250,000, 5 per cent up to &pound;925,000, 10 per cent up to &pound;1.5 million, and 12 per cent on everything above that.</p>\r\n<p>The new system took effect from midnight last Wednesday meaning homeowners will benefit instantly. If you are in the process of purchasing a home, you now have the option of choosing the regime under which you wish to operate.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How Has The Industry Responded?</strong> Broadly speaking, the move has been well received. Property experts say it is particularly good news for buyers, as only those paying more than &pound;937,500 will pay more tax than under the current system.</p>\r\n<p>The only exception is some anomalies around the &pound;1 million mark (see calculator Hmrc.gov.uk/tools/ sdlt/land-and-property.htm). For example, someone purchasing at &pound;550,000 will now pay &pound;17,500 rather than &pound;22,000."</p>\r\n<p>However, while 98 per cent will benefit, someone purchasing at &pound;1.5 million will now pay &pound;93,750 rather than &pound;75,000. This will hit those in London and the South-east harder.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What Does It Mean For First-Time Buyers?</strong> The move could be particularly beneficial to first-timers.</p>\r\n<p>For example, someone buying a &pound;185,000 property under the Government''s Help to Buy scheme will save &pound;650 under the reforms. The changes will reduce the up-front costs for newer buyers.</p>\r\n<p>This will provide a further boost to Government-assistance schemes, such as Help to Buy, which have been extremely valuable in getting people on to the housing ladder.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What Will Happen To Prices?</strong> Property experts say the changes could have an impact on house prices.

These rules must now be &ldquo;re-interpreted&rdquo; as a result of the recent Lock vs British Gas ruling by the ECJ. &nbsp;The type of payments that need to form part of holiday pay calculations now include average overtime payments, shift supplements (for example, unsocial hours payments) and standard travel supplements (as opposed to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses). &nbsp;Where these payments vary, then they will need to be calculated taking into account a twelve week reference period. What is less clear is the position in relation to bonuses and commissions and it is likely that these issues will be the addressed in later cases. &nbsp;However, it would appear that regular bonuses and commissions would need to be taken into account but annual bonuses would not.</p>\r\n<p>Katie Ash, comments &ldquo;The changes to holiday pay calculation can add significantly to costs for a small firm; although the setting up of clear policies and procedures can go a long way to mitigate this&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>If you would like assistance in relation to any employment issues, call the Employment Law department at Banner Jones Solicitors on <strong>01246 560560</strong>, or email <a href="mailto:info@bannerjones.co.uk">info@bannerjones.co.uk </a>for further information.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '2015-01-07', '108_iStock_000013859617XSmall.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 98164, '2015-01-07 09:24:29', '', '2015-01-07 09:23:09', '2015-01-07 09:31:58', 2, 2, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

He purchased a laptop computer from PC World and entered a debtor-creditor-supplier agreement with a bank under section 12(b) of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 to fund the purchase, apart from a deposit which he paid.</p>\r\n<p>When he took his purchase home he discovered that the laptop did not have an internal modem.

The store refused to accept his rejection of the goods and took no steps to cancel the credit agreement.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Durkin did not pay any money to the bank under the credit agreement. However, without making any enquiries about Mr Durkin&rsquo;s claim that he had rescinded both the contract of sale and the credit agreement, the bank issued a default notice and intimated to two credit reference agencies that he was in default of his obligations under the credit agreement. They recorded the alleged default on their registers.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Durkin raised a small claims action against PC World and recovered his deposit in an out-of-court settlement in which PC World did not admit any liability.

He found that the entries on the credit registers prevented him from opening new accounts with credit card companies and other lending institutions. Mr Durkin therefore raised an action against both PC World and the bank.</p>\r\n<p>The courts held that PC World had been in material breach of contract entitling him to rescind the sale contract and that section 75 of the 1974 Act had the effect that he had been entitled to rescind and had rescinded both the sale contract and the credit agreement. &nbsp;The Bank was held to have failed in its duty of care to the litigant in that it simply accepted PC World&rsquo;s assertion that the credit agreement was not rescinded and had not made adequate enquiries before issuing its default notice; with the subsequent ramifications.</p>\r\n<p>Rob Stubbs of Banner Jones Solicitors, comments &ldquo;It is a common misconception, when a product is bought under a credit agreement, that returning the product to the supplier also nullifies the credit agreement automatically. &nbsp;It does not.

There is a lot of unsold stock from last year, although this is normal forJanuary. Anyone who has rested a property over the winter, hoping to relaunch it in the spring, should be doing it right; but at a lower price to attract attention.</p>\r\n<h2>Look at Your Sales Strategy</h2>\r\n<p>You need to look at how long the property has been for sale, how many viewings it has had, and find out from your agents what people say and don&rsquo;t say about it.<br />Analysis of how much time people spend looking at your property online is revealing. For example, if you get lots of hits online, but no viewings, it could mean that although the location is popular, and the type of house is desirable, the property is probably too expensive, or that buyers don&rsquo;t like that all the rooms are painted pink.<br />Technology sometimes doesn&rsquo;t help. The &ldquo;Google-effect&rdquo; can be a problem because people check maps online and think there is a motorway too close, when in fact it is half a mile away with a hill in between.<br />Properties can be like internet dating; you need to see them in person, not just look at their Facebook page.</p>\r\n<h2>Be Decisive</h2>\r\n<p>If you get an offer, don&rsquo;t hang about. There tends to be a surge in property hunters at the beginning of the year as people act out their New Year resolutions.</p>\r\n<h2>Remember the Election</h2>\r\n<p>The general election on May 7 just happens to be in one of the most important weeks in the property market calendar. Usually, more houses are launched then than at any other time of year. So it may not only be a lost weekend, but possibly a lost month for sellers.<br />Previous elections show that the market slows down around six weeks beforehand. Property has shot up the agenda, and has become more politicised since the credit crunch. While stamp duty changes will boost demand in the mainstream market, at the upper end the changes will combine with the threat of mansion tax to make buyers at &pound;2m very cautious.<br />Sellers have to make a call on whether to sell before the election with that threat in the air, or take a punt and sell afterwards.</p>\r\n<h2>Consider Taking the Property Temporarily off the Market</h2>\r\n<p>Sellers often feel their properties go stale after a few months sitting in estate agents&rsquo; windows. A rest and a return can often refresh the property.<br />The first question buyers ask is often &ldquo;How long has it been on the market?&rdquo; If a property lingers, buyers can start to suspect there is something wrong with it. It may also mean that there is an opportunity to make an offer, as the seller could be flexible on price.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '2015-02-12', 'SellarsMarket.png', 'image/png', 729728, '2015-02-12 10:34:10', '', '2015-02-12 10:32:23', '2015-02-12 10:34:11', 2, 2, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

(342, 'MARCH MARKET COMMENTARY', 'At last! A full house, ladies and gentlemen. For the first time since we started this bulletin all the major world stock markets moved resolutely upwards in February. Some by a little, some by a lot and some – step forward the UK – finally breaking through a previous high from the last century.', '<p>Whether this was due to good news or merely the absence of bad news I&rsquo;ll leave you to judge at the end of the bulletin. February was the month when the world&rsquo;s leaders couldn&rsquo;t reach a compromise: when they were &lsquo;miles apart&rsquo; when one side or other had stormed out of the negotiations, only for an agreement to be reached at the eleventh hour &ndash; usually at a few minutes to midnight&hellip; For the Greek debt crisis read the Ukraine ceasefire &ndash; and several other potential flashpoints around the world.</p>\r\n<p>As most of you will know by now, Syriza, a far-left coalition, has recently taken power in Greece on a platform of re-negotiating the country&rsquo;s debts. Negotiations rumbled on throughout February with both sides initially refusing to compromise. The problem for Greece though, was that they had to compromise, given that money was flowing out of the country and the Greek banks &ndash; despite a cash injection from the ECB &ndash; were in real danger of running out of money.</p>\r\n<p>In the event an agreement was reached on a four month extension to the bail-out, so Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and his German counterpart, Wolfgang Schauble, will be able to do it all again in June. The problem for Syriza will be selling the deal to the Greek public because the German government &ndash; wary of a potentially similar situation in Italy and Spain &ndash; will not give concessions easily.</p>\r\n<p>Fighting continued in the Ukraine despite a ceasefire being agreed, and the key town of Debaltseve is now in rebel hands. Back on the streets of Moscow Boris Nemtsov, an opposition spokesman fiercely opposed to the war in the Ukraine, was murdered. Expect to hear more of the implications of this story in future bulletins&hellip;</p>\r\n<h2><span>UK</span></h2>\r\n<p>As we&rsquo;ve written many times in this bulletin, the all-time high of the FTSE 100 index of leading shares was 6,930, recorded on 30th December 1999 at the height of the dot-com boom. It took 15 years but this level was finally passed on February 24th with the index closing that day at 6,949. The FTSE finally closed February at 6,947 &ndash; up 3% in the month.</p>\r\n<p>The news for the UK economy was mostly good during February. Unemployment fell to 1.86m and figures for January confirmed an &pound;8.8bn surplus in the public finances &ndash; which would see the Government on course to reduce borrowing this year.</p>\r\n<p>The Office for National Statistics confirmed that house prices had risen by 9.8% in the year to December &ndash; although there were the usual regional variations in that &ndash; and BT agreed a deal to acquire EE for &pound;12bn.</p>\r\n<p>UK inflation fell to a record low of 0.3% in January with lower food and fuel prices the main driver. Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England warned that inflation could turn negative in the Spring, which would raise the spectre of deflation.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile there were plenty of spectres for Tesco, which is now under investigation from the Groceries Code Adjudicator for unfairly delaying payments to suppliers, and for HSBC, which was allegedly found to have helped clients &lsquo;cheat the taxman of millions.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Finally there was also bad news in the North Sea, where the oil and gas sector was reported to have lost &pound;5.3bn last year. With one analyst suggesting that oil could fall as low as $10 a barrel the outlook is not good for that sector of the economy.</p>\r\n<h2><span>Europe</span></h2>\r\n<p>Europe seemed to be at the centre of everything in February. Obviously the negotiations over Greek debts took centre stage, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande were also heavily involved in trying to broker a peace deal in the Ukraine. They managed to do this but, as we&rsquo;ve reported above, the words &lsquo;uneasy truce&rsquo; are something of an understatement.</p>\r\n<p>There was good news for Frau Merkel when she returned home, when it was confirmed that Germany had recorded a record trade surplus of &euro;21.8bn in December as exports rose 3.4% in the month and imports dropped by 0.8%. This gave Germany an average monthly surplus of &euro;18.2bn for 2014 and the economy looks well placed to profit from the continuing low level of the euro.</p>\r\n<p>Germany&rsquo;s overall economic growth for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 0.7% (meaning the UK can no longer claim to be the fastest growing large economy in Europe). This contrasted sharply with France, where the economy only grew at 0.1%.</p>\r\n<p>Not surprisingly, business confidence in Germany is at a 12 month high: Volkswagen, for example, saw profits in 2014 climb 21% to &euro;10.8bn. It warned of &lsquo;tough challenges ahead&rsquo; but still expects revenue to rise by 4% in 2015.</p>\r\n<p>On the stock markets the news was unremittingly good. The German DAX index was up 7% to close February at 11,402 and the French market was up 8% at 4,951. The star performer though was Greece &ndash; their market rose 22% in February as the bailout extension was agreed.</p>\r\n<h2><span>US</span></h2>\r\n<p>As it was in the UK, so it was in the US. On 25th February Janet Yellen, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve said that the Fed could &ndash; and would &ndash; be &lsquo;flexible on setting interest rates.&rsquo; The markets took this as a signal that they would stay low for some time and both the Dow Jones and the Standard &amp; Poors 500 Index went to record highs. The Dow finally finished February at 18,133 &ndash; up 6% in the month.</p>\r\n<p>This was no surprise, considering the good news from the jobs market. Figures for January confirmed that 257,000 jobs had been added in the month and the numbers for November and December were also revised sharply upwards. January was the 11th consecutive month in which more than 200,000 jobs were created &ndash; the best run since 1994 and clear evidence that the recovery in the US is continuing.</p>\r\n<p>&hellip;And good news was also continuing at Twitter as the shares soared on the back of a continued rise in ad revenues, which were up 97% to $479m in the fourth quarter. Of course, the company still isn&rsquo;t doing anything as old-fashioned as making a profit &ndash; but losses for the quarter were &lsquo;only&rsquo; $125m compared to a loss of $511m in the same quarter last year. Traditionalists look away now&hellip;</p>\r\n<h2><span>Far East</span></h2>\r\n<p>So much for all the talk of all-time stock market highs: we always need to remember Japan, where the Nikkei Dow peaked at 38,957 on December 29th 1989. Nothing like that level has been seen since and the index has spent plenty of time below 10,000. Nevertheless, the market hit a 15 year high in February as the trade deficit halved on lower oil prices and a strong rise in exports. The market finished February up 6% at 18,798.</p>\r\n<p>There was a less dramatic rise in China &ndash; the market was up 3% in February to 3,310 &ndash; but the real headlines there were made by the trade surplus. The figures for January showed a record surplus of $60bn, up from $49bn in December and almost double the figure for January 2014. Interest rates were cut to 5.35% and inflation eased to a five year low.</p>\r\n<p>South Korea also saw its trade surplus increase in January &ndash; up to $5.53bn &ndash; and the market responded with a 2% rise to close February at 1,986.</p>\r\n<p>Hong Kong very nearly let us down for the full house, but fortunately the market shrugged off concerns about another round of pro-democracy protests and managed to finish February up 1% at 24,823.</p>\r\n<h2><span>Emerging Markets</span></h2>\r\n<p>Despite the continuing tension in the Ukraine and the ever-present threat of increased sanctions from the EU, the stock market in Russia has performed strongly in recent months. It was up a further 7% in February to close at 1,759 and is up more than 25% in the last six months, despite the fall in the oil price.</p>\r\n<p>The Indian market did less well in February, rising by only 1% to 29,361. Nevertheless the economy continues to grow strongly, recording growth of 7.5% in the last quarter of 2014 &ndash; a faster rate of growth than that seen in China.</p>\r\n<p>The real star among the major emerging markets we report on was Brazil, where the stock market rose 10% in February to 51,583. It is still well down on the 61,288 which it hit in August of last year, but at least it seems to be moving in the right direction again.</p>\r\n<p><span>And finally&hellip;</span></p>\r\n<p>We reported recently on the huge profits recorded by Apple. Their latest product that we&rsquo;ll soon discover we can&rsquo;t live without is the Apple watch. CEO Tim Cook was extolling the health benefits of the watch and, in particular, the way it prompts you to get up and move around.

The average British wage is about £26,000 – to replicate that in retirement you’d need a pension pot of more than £300,000.', '<p><span>Budgeting for retirement can be more difficult than budgeting whilst you&rsquo;re still working. Some costs may increase, such as heating your home, and you&rsquo;ll have to work out exactly how much income you will be receiving from your pension. The average British wage is about &pound;26,000 &ndash; to replicate that in retirement you&rsquo;d need a pension pot of more than &pound;300,000.&nbsp;<br /></span>However, according to &lsquo;Which?&rsquo; it&rsquo;s unlikely that you&rsquo;ll need as much money in retirement as you did while you were working, although the amount clearly depends upon your own hopes and expectations of how you will enjoy your retirement! In our experience with clients, in early years of retirement they tend to spend the same level of income, or more.</p>\r\n<p>When sitting down to plan your retirement budget, it&rsquo;s a good idea to first get some idea of your current spending. A report by &lsquo;Which&rsquo; suggests keeping three months&rsquo; worth of bank and credit card statements, payslips going back three months and three months of shopping receipts &ndash; remembering to factor in one-off spends like birthdays, Christmas, holidays and car repairs. Then work out where you think you&rsquo;ll spend more once you&rsquo;ve retired &ndash; because your situation is changing so will your spending habits. You&rsquo;ll need to compare this with how much income you&rsquo;ll be getting in retirement (from pensions, benefits or savings), to find out if there are any shortfalls.</p>\r\n<p>The above simple plan is a long way off proper financial planning, but it should provide a handy starting point for indicating the income you might need in your retirement. Once you know that, we can set about working out exactly what you do need to make sure you can do everything you want in your later life.</p>\r\n<p>It is also worth bearing in mind that the sums of money you spend on certain things can change for the better in retirement. The following are again good suggestions to start considering.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Have you paid off your mortgage? If so, that will significantly reduce your monthly spend. However, if you&rsquo;re still renting in retirement, you&rsquo;ll have to factor that cost into your outgoings when budgeting.</li>\r\n<li>Have your children moved out? Raising a child until they&rsquo;re 18 costs almost &pound;220,000 in total &ndash; so your costs should come down significantly once they&rsquo;ve flown the nest.</li>\r\n<li>You&rsquo;ll save on commuting. The average annual rail cost of commuting into London for example, is &pound;3,800, and that&rsquo;s without factoring in parking at train stations.</li>\r\n<li>Public transport. Over-60s get free off-peak travel on buses. And if you live in London, you can claim a Freedom Pass, which means you can use London&rsquo;s public transport for free.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Some spending in retirement can typically go up, however:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span>Leisure spending</span>&nbsp;&ndash; you&rsquo;ll probably be spending more money on hobbies and holidays. Think about how many holidays you&rsquo;ll want to take per year and remember to take advantage of senior discounts on dining out and theatre tickets.</li>\r\n<li><span>Travel insurance</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Which? research has found that people over 65 tend to pay more because statistically, they&rsquo;re more likely to fall ill whilst on holiday. Shopping around will help secure you the best deal.</li>\r\n<li><span>Heating</span>. As you&rsquo;ll be spending more time at home, the chances are bills will be higher. The Winter Fuel Payment, currently available to people born on or before 5 July 1952, could get you between &pound;100 and &pound;300 tax-free towards your fuel bills.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Planning for Retirement needs to go beyond this sort of initial informal research to fully include careful attention to Lifestyle Planning, but the above initial considerations should help you to start thinking about whether your current savings are going to be enough to do everything you want to do with your retirement.</p>\r\n<p>If you would like to talk to us about full financial planning for your retirement, before or after your retirement, or your guidance guarantee session with Pension Wise, then please feel free to get in touch with us and we will be more than happy to discuss your individual situation</p>\r\n<p><strong>For more information, or to arrange an appointment, call 01246 560570</strong><strong>&nbsp;or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@bannerjoneswm.co.uk">info@bannerjoneswm.co.uk</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p>_________________________________________________________________________________</p>\r\n<p>Sources: www.which.co.uk (Published advice on the website: January 2015)</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><sub>Image Courtesy of Freedigitalphotos.net</sub></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '2015-03-05', 'id-100137439.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 33944, '2015-03-05 14:07:12', '', '2015-03-05 14:07:12', '2015-03-05 14:11:53', 2, 2, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

Below, we look at some of the most common retirement worries and how they can be mitigated by having one eye on the detail.</p>\r\n<h2>1 &ndash; Will I have enough funds to last throughout my retirement?</h2>\r\n<p>The best financial advice and careful planning is absolutely key here, especially in light of the far-reaching Pensions Reforms that come into force from 6th April. Having greater control over your pension means yet more serious decisions to make. New retirees are faced with a complex range of choices as it is, often having several pension pots to juggle and likely scenarios to plan for. Not all pension providers are intending to adopt the new flexibilities and transferring to new plans can take weeks, so carefully working out what you have and what you want to do with it is key.</p>\r\n<h2>2 &ndash; What if my health fails?</h2>\r\n<p>Your health is paramount to enjoying a good quality of life. Private health insurance schemes can often give peace of mind, but choosing the wrong one can be costly. A recent study found that one in four of us will require care in later years and the cost can be astronomical (1 in 10 of us will incur costs over &pound;100k). The Government&rsquo;s new care capping rules for 2016 will also have an impact. Preparing for and thoroughly planning for the worst whilst enjoying the best of your retirement is both prudent and very possible.</p>\r\n<h2>3 &ndash; Will I get bored and lonely?</h2>\r\n<p>Retirement should be the time we get to do those things we have always dreamed of, but if you haven&rsquo;t settled on a bucket list and are worrying about stagnating in your leisure days, why not retire in a staged manner, cutting down hours to part-time as you gradually accustom yourself to the change? Many retirees favour this approach as it keeps them mentally and physically active, they continue to feel useful and the income is always handy for those future plans!</p>\r\n<h2>4 &ndash; I might be fleeced by a scam artist!</h2>\r\n<p>The most radical change to the pensions industry in a generation has unfortunately spawned a number of opportunists out to fleece savers. An increased number of unregulated investment firms are actively pursuing over 55&rsquo;s and their newly free pension savings. High-earning professionals, you may be surprised to learn, are the most likely to fall victim. Always make certain that the firm you are dealing with is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and get in touch with the regulator directly if you are uncertain. The FCA want to know about these naughty boys and girls.</p>\r\n<h2>5 &ndash; The Unexpected</h2>\r\n<p>Everyone fears the unknown and no matter how sensible we are and how much preparation we do, we cannot plan for every eventuality. The recent financial crisis, for example, dented the confidence of many. The only sensible approach is to make sure that your investment portfolio has a balance of risk and ability for loss, appropriate to your own approach.

Estate agents are already reporting interest from people eyeing up a potential buy-to-let.</p>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve had inquiries from a number of older people considering <a href="../../page/buying" target="_blank">buy-to-let</a> which is likely to have an effect this year, with interest expressed particularly in smaller flats where yields are higher. There is clear competition with first-time buyers &ndash; the cheaper properties tending to get snapped up quite quickly.</p>\r\n<p>Rightmove said the distraction of the looming election and the introduction of tighter lending rules last year meant that the rise in prices was more muted than that recorded in mid-March 2014, and the lowest seen at this time of year for three years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The average asking price of homes coming up for sale rose by &pound;2,748 to &pound;281,752 &ndash; just &pound;30 below the high reached last June 2014. The annual rate of increase fell to 5.4%, although first-time buyer properties are priced 7.6% higher than a year ago.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Miles Shipside, Rightmove director and housing market analyst, said changes such as the new lending rules brought in with the mortgage market review (MMR) and the Bank of England&rsquo;s cap on big mortgages had acted as a brake on rising prices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, buy-to-let loans are not included in the MMR changes and with supply of first-time buyer homes up by just 2.6% over the month, new landlords could put extra pressure on prices.</p>\r\n<p>Shipside said: &ldquo;<em>The lower-end properties favoured by first-time buyers and investors are in short supply in many locations due to increased competition among mortgage lenders, who are also chasing landlords with offers of low rates for lower risk. Some cash-rich pension pot buy-to-let investors will also be tempted by those tax-deductible mortgage rates, creating further upwards price pressure in a market sector that is already out-stripping the higher-priced ones</em>.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>But he added: &ldquo;<em>When the realities of the possible tax penalties on larger withdrawals are better understood by aspiring new landlords, their appetite for buy-to-let may diminish and anticipated demand may be less than speculated. It&rsquo;s a hard one to call</em>.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Although the number of buyers entering the housing market has dropped off since last year, the disconnect between supply and demand is still pushing up prices. Rightmove said estate agents had an average of 59 properties on their books in February &ndash; up from 58 in January but below the 63 each at the same period last year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Asking prices continued to fall in London, Rightmove said, dropping by 0.4% during the month to mid-March to an average of &pound;580,308. In contrast, in the east of England they increased by 2.5%, to &pound;297,863, suggesting sellers are hoping to cash in on the ripple effect from the capital.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href="../../team_members/36">Chris Sellars</a></strong><br />Solicitor, Executive Director, Head of Residential Property Services</p>\r\n<p>Banner Jones Solicitors<br />24 Glumangate<br />Chesterfield<br />Tel 01246 560560<br />Fax 01246 220390<br /><a href="mailto:info@bannerjones.co.uk">info@bannerjones.co.uk</a></p>', '2015-03-17', '401_SellarsMarket.png', 'image/png', 729728, '2015-03-17 13:01:27', '', '2015-03-17 13:01:28', '2015-04-27 14:31:34', 2, 2, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

The key element to these cases was the fact there was a financial order in place that both applicants were looking to try and reopen.</p>\r\n<p>In the headline case this week of Wyatt v. Vince the Supreme Court have allowed the wife&rsquo;s claims for a financial remedy to be considered by the Family Court, despite the fact that the parties had been divorced for 20 years.</p>\r\n<p>The husband in this case had started a business approximately three years after the divorce had been finalised, which had turned into a very successful green energy business. The difference between the case of Wyatt v. Vince as compared to Myerson or Walkden is that in this most recent case the parties never entered into a final financial clean break order.</p>\r\n<p>Because of this, the Supreme Court were entirely right that both parties&rsquo; claims one against the other, remain open for the court to consider.</p>\r\n<p>What is not known at this stage is the likely size of the payment that Ms Wyatt will receive. This could in fact be zero. She has pitched her offer at &pound;1.9 Million, but there has already been an indication from the Supreme Court Judges that this was highly inflated.</p>\r\n<p>However, the Supreme Court will not be hearing the financial remedy case and this will be dealt with by a Judge at a low level within the Family Court.</p>\r\n<p>The lesson to be learned from this is that no matter your circumstances at the time you divorce, you should put in place a <a href="../../../page/financial-settlements">clean break financial order</a> to cover off all eventualities.</p>\r\n<p>A court will take into consideration whether assets were acquired pre or post separation and divorce, however, there is an overriding need to meet the needs of both parties and of any dependent children and therefore a court may be minded to make some provision where, none may have been made had a simple financial clean break order been filed with the court when the marriage was brought to a conclusion.</p>\r\n<p>Although you may think that this would not affect you because you are not looking to <a href="../../../page/starting-a-business">set up a business</a> that could be worth many millions of pounds in the future, the same principle would apply in relation to a lottery win.</p>\r\n<p>I had a case where a relatively large lottery win did lead to a financial settlement being paid to a former spouse because at the time that the lottery winner got divorced there were no assets to be divided between them.</p>\r\n<p>At that stage a view was taken not to enter into a financial clean break order, as a result of which the wife&rsquo;s financial claims remained open and financial claims were still there to be considered.</p>\r\n<p>In this particular case, my client was content that his former wife and children should benefit from his lottery win and agreement was reached without recourse to contested court hearing.</p>\r\n<p>It is however a point that should be considered by everybody and if you do not have a financial clean break order in place you should give further consideration to contacting one of the <a href="../../../page/family">Family Teams</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>For more information on divorce, or to arrange an appointment with our expert Family Law department, call 0330 017 6309</strong>*<strong>&nbsp;or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@bannerjones.co.uk">info@bannerjones.co.uk</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p>*<strong><sub>calls cost no more than a local 01 number and are included in your mobile minutes.</sub></strong></p>', '2015-03-18', '29_IMG_5299.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 95798, '2015-03-18 12:56:41', '', '2015-03-17 15:25:57', '2015-03-18 15:10:36', 2, 2, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

There are some other changes on the horizon that we wanted to make you aware of.</p>\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s an overview of what&rsquo;s happening and when:</p>\r\n<h2>Shared Parental Leave</h2>\r\n<p>Although introduced in January 2015 only parents with babies born<a href="http://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/overview" target="_blank"> on or after 05 April 2015</a> can take advantage of the shared parental leave provisions which enable parents to share up to 52 weeks leave and 39 weeks pay.</p>\r\n<p>Shared parental leave also applies to adoptions where the match takes place on or after 05 April 2015.</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">Parental Leave</span></p>\r\n<p>From 05 April 2015 parents will have a right to request parental leave until their child reaches the age of 18. Currently the age limit is 5 years (unless the child is disabled).</p>\r\n<p>Parental leave enables a parent to request up to 18 weeks unpaid leave.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Adoption Leave</strong></h2>\r\n<p><a href="http://www.gov.uk/adoption-pay-leave/overview" target="_blank">Adoption leave </a>becomes available from day one of an employee&rsquo;s employment with effect from the 05 April 2015. This brings it in to line with other types of leave, including maternity.</p>\r\n<p><strong style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">Adoption Pay</strong></p>\r\n<p>From 05 April 2015 the rate of <a href="http://www.gov.uk/employers-adoption-pay-leave/entitlement" target="_blank">Statutory Adoption Pay</a> is brought in to line with Statutory Maternity Pay, meaning that the rate of pay will be 90 per cent of the employee&rsquo;s normal earnings (subject to the minimum threshold).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The provisions with regards to length of service eligibility have not changed with regards to pay. An employee still therefore has to be employed for 26 weeks (and satisfy other qualifying criteria).</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">Adoption Appointments</span></p>\r\n<p>The main adopter can attend up to 5 adoption appointments and be paid for these.

A maximum of 2 unpaid antenatal appointments with the surrogate will also be available to both parents.</p>\r\n<p><strong style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">Holiday Pay Claims</strong></p>\r\n<p>Following the much publicised cases in the Autumn of 2014 which allowed claims for holiday pay to include overtime going back, the <a href="http://www.acas.org.uk/holidaypay#limit-on-a-claim" target="_blank">Government will limit</a> the maximum amount of backpay to 2 years for claims brought on or after 01 July 2015.</p>\r\n<p>Currently employees have the potential to claim for unpaid holiday pay as far back as the introduction of the Working Time Regulations in 1998!</p>\r\n<p><strong style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">Fit for Work Service</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href="http://fitforwork.org/" target="_blank">This service</a> is being rolled out across the country by May 2015.

Pensions are designed to provide income in retirement. Therefore it is essential for anyone approaching retirement to stop, seek advice and plan how this investment is to be used.</p>\r\n<p>People tend to under-estimate their longevity.

Mental capacity can be lost gradually (perhaps as a result of dementia) or instantly (perhaps as a result of an accident or stroke). LPAs are designed to be recognised by financial institutions, care homes and local authorities, as well as tax, benefits and pension authorities.</p>\r\n<p>There are two types of LPA: one that can cover decisions about money and property matters, known as a Property and Financial Affairs LPA, and one that can cover decisions about healthcare, known as a Personal Welfare LPA.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>A person administering a Property and Financial Affairs LPA can make decisions on things such as buying and selling your property, dealing with your bills, running your bank accounts and investing your money. They can do this for you while you still have capacity.</li>\r\n<li>A Personal Welfare LPA on the other hand can only be used when capacity has been lost and someone administering this type of LPA can make decisions on your behalf about where you should live, how you should be treated medically, what you should eat and who you should have contact with.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>If you are a couple you can have mirror LPAs which act in the same way <a href="../../page/types-of-wills" target="_blank">mirror Wills</a> do. &nbsp;You are able to appoint multiple attorneys in your LPA if you wish, which does help to protect you should one of the people you appoint also lose capacity, which does happen. To protect your interests, an LPA must be signed by a certificate provider, which is someone who certifies that you understand the LPA and have not been pressurised into signing it. You solicitor can do this for you or you could choose close friends or relatives (different to your chosen attorneys) who must be formally told that you are setting up an LPA and be given the opportunity to raise any concerns.</p>\r\n<p>Before it can be used, an LPA must also be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian. This process can take a number of weeks; therefore we always encourage clients to consider making an LPA long before it&rsquo;s needed so that it&rsquo;s ready and waiting for when the time comes. Where there are doubts about a person&rsquo;s capacity, such as during the very early stages of Dementia, it may be necessary to obtain a medical opinion which will add to the cost of the LPA and delay the process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>What happens if I don&rsquo;t have one?</h2>\r\n<p>If you do not have an LPA and you lose mental capacity then all is not lost. One person can make an application to the Court of Protection to be appointed as your Deputy. &nbsp;Be aware though that this process can take several months and it&rsquo;s expensive as the Court fee alone is &pound;400. &nbsp;During this period your bank accounts and other assets may be frozen and be inaccessible which can be very stressful for you and your family.</p>\r\n<p>I have some clients who have recently been through this with their elderly parents and asked me soon after to write LPAs for themselves, simply because they couldn&rsquo;t bare the thought of going through the stress of the Court process again. Dementia is becoming a major concern in the UK with one in five people over 85 already suffering from it, with rates significantly higher among women than men.

(355, 'Sellars Market', 'Housing Market High on the Election Agenda', '<h1><strong>Housing Market High on the Election Agenda</strong></h1>\r\n<p>With the election now just days away all parties are making high profile pledges on the housing market. This week the Labour Party announced plans for a &pound;300,000 stamp duty limit for first time buyers whilst the Tories are seeking to introduce the Right to Buy scheme for housing association homes.</p>\r\n<p>However, extending the right-to-buy scheme could undermine the UK&rsquo;s public finances, according to an assessment of the Conservative party&rsquo;s flagship policy by the Institute of Fiscal Studies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The independent tax think tank warned that selling off housing association homes would &ldquo;represent a significant giveaway &hellip; potentially billions of pounds over the next parliament&rdquo; and would &ldquo;worsen the UK&rsquo;s underlying public finance position&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>It said given the &ldquo;less-than-impressive record&rdquo; of delivering replacement social housing under the existing right to buy, &ldquo;there is a risk that these policies will lead to a further depletion of the social housing stock &ndash; something the proposal explicitly seeks to avoid&rdquo;. It also called into question a series of financial assumptions made by the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives">Conservatives</a> about how much would be raised from sales.</p>\r\n<p>In 2012, the right-leaning Policy Exchange group, which first proposed selling off more expensive social housing stock in 2012, estimated revenues in the region of &pound;160,000 per property. But just three years later, the Conservative proposal assumes revenues of &pound;300,000 per property. &ldquo;It is not clear why the expected revenue per property is so much higher,&rdquo; said the report&rsquo;s authors, Daniel Chandler and Richard Disney.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Conservatives have also assumed that about 15,000 high-value council properties will become vacant each year, and their sale would help fund subsidies to housing association sell-offs. This suggests a natural turnover rate of 7% a year as tenants die or quit their homes, yet Policy Exchange had previously said the turnover rate would be only half that level.</p>\r\n<p>Brandon Lewis, minister for housing, said: &ldquo;Since Conservatives reinvigorated the Right to Buy for council housing in 2012, we have helped 33,000 families into home ownership and boosted council house building to a 23-year high. Our plans to extend the Right to Buy to housing associations will similarly boost social housing construction and reduce housing waiting lists. In Scotland, Labour and the SNP voted to abolish the Right to Buy, and Labour now plan the same for Wales. Labour and the SNP are the enemies of aspiration and would kick hard-working people off the first rung of the housing ladder.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Selling off the best council stock would also risk heightening social division, the IFS said. &ldquo;Sales of expensive local authority properties would reduce the availability of social housing in the most expensive areas, thereby creating clearer divisions between areas where richer and poorer households are located.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>An estimated 1.3 million housing association tenants will be offered the right to buy their home, with subsidies increased to &pound;103,900. &ldquo;There is an upfront cost associated with this policy, because the government would compensate housing associations for having to sell their assets at a discount so they receive the full market price. An increase in right-to-buy sales would amount to a substantial giveaway to a relatively small number of households,&rdquo; the IFS said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The National <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/housing">Housing</a> Federation has estimated up to 221,000 households could afford to exercise their right to buy, at a total cost of &pound;11.6bn. But the IFS said this represented &ldquo;an upper bound on the total cost&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>The fact remains that there is cross party agreement that we simply need more homes. If we sell off stock we need to be able to afford to build more affordable homes. It can only be the case that if they are sold too cheap there will not be enough money to build new ones. Whilst tenants have paid rent for many years, so have many home owners paid interest on their mortgages and not received interest on their savings used as a deposit.</p>\r\n<p>We can only have what we can afford, and I wonder whether many of the promises about the housing market from all parties can actually turn into reality.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href="../../team_members/36">Chris Sellars</a></strong><br />Solicitor, Executive Director, Head of Residential Property Services</p>\r\n<p>Banner Jones Solicitors<br />24 Glumangate<br />Chesterfield<br />Tel 01246 560560<br />Fax 01246 220390<br /><a href="mailto:info@bannerjones.co.uk">info@bannerjones.co.uk</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/@bannerjones" target="_blank">www.twitter.com/@bannerjones</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=38326917" target="_blank">www.linkedin.com/chrissellars</a></p>', '2015-04-27', '401_SellarsMarket.png', 'image/png', 729728, '2015-04-27 14:45:21', '', '2015-04-27 14:45:22', '2015-04-27 14:45:22', 2, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

The maximum amount that buyers can borrow with a Welcome Home Loan varies by region, but tops out at $550,000 (&pound;275,000) in Auckland.</p>\r\n<p>Single buyers can earn a maximum annual income of $80,000 (&pound;40,000) to qualify, while couples can earn up to $120,000 (&pound;60,000).</p>\r\n<p>Some lenders also allow you to build a new house with the Welcome Home Loan.

Those who have never divorced will carry a slightly smaller debt burden into retirement (average debts of &pound;21,700).<br /> <br /> Prudential&rsquo;s results also show that people approaching retirement who have been divorced <strong><span>(13%) are more likely to delay the date of their retirement compared to those who have never been divorced (11%)</span></strong>. One in five (19%) of retirees who have been divorced expect to live in retirement with an income below the Joseph Rowntree Foundation minimum income standard for a single pensioner of &pound;9,500 &ndash; compared with 14% for those who have never divorced.<br /> <br /> Clare Moffat, a pension&rsquo;s specialist at Prudential, said:<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Although the emotional impact of divorce may have long passed, it could come as a shock for people to find that it continues to impact them financially into their retirement. A pension fund is likely to be one of the largest and most complicated assets a couple <a href="../../page/financial-settlements">will have to split </a>in the event of a divorce.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;The support of a professional financial adviser or retirement specialist should help ensure that any financial decisions taken have the least possible impact on incomes available later in life. <strong><span>Professional advice is particularly important in the face of the recent changes to pension&rsquo;s legislation and divorced retirees acting on advice received under the previous rules may want to consider seeking updated advice on any post-retirement plans they have made.</span></strong><br /> <br /> &ldquo;During a divorce, the costs can quickly mount up, with legal fees, the cost of setting up a new home and the effect of splitting any existing retirement savings all potentially impacting the ability of those involved to continue saving into a pension. Unfortunately, divorce is most likely among those aged 40-44, the period in many people&rsquo;s lives when earning potential peaks and the most valuable pension contributions can be made.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Jill Thomas,</strong></h2>\r\n<p><a href="../../page/wealth-management" target="_blank"></a><a href="../../../page/wealth-management-services" target="_blank"><img src="../../assets/articles/351/contained_images/b75b2d332dca_178_BJ_WEALTH_MANAGEMENT_WHITE.JPG?1363685036" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="250" /></a></p>\r\n<p><strong>For more information, or to arrange an appointment, call <a href="mailto:01246 560570"><strong><a href="tel:+441246560570" target="_blank"><span>01246 560570</span></a></strong></a></strong><strong>&nbsp;or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@bannerjoneswm.co.uk">info@bannerjoneswm.co.uk</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p><span><sub>Sources: www.pru.co.uk (Article published: 2015/04/16)&nbsp;</sub></span></p>', '2015-06-05', '70_iStock_000003657042XSmall.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 127802, '2015-06-05 10:41:21', '', '2015-06-05 10:41:22', '2015-06-05 10:54:30', 2, 2, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

(372, 'Personal savings shortfall?', 'The state pension may not be the answer to bridging it.', '<h2>The state pension may not be the answer to bridging it.</h2>\r\n<p>The typical working over-45 year old faces a &pound;8,955 annual retirement income gap based on their current savings and investments &ndash; meaning they will rely heavily on a state pension that will still leave them short, the latest Aviva Real Retirement Report shows.</p>\r\n<p>The report reveals that over-45s, who are not yet retired, typically expect to need an annual income of &pound;12,590 from their savings and investments when they retire. But Aviva&rsquo;s analysis shows their typical current savings and investments only amount to &pound;53,793, which would deliver income of &pound;3,117 a year if an annuity is bought or &pound;3,635 each year if invested in a drawdown plan over 25 years. This means the typical person only has enough private savings to finance 29% of their target income: leaving them with a potentially crippling &pound;8,955 retirement income gap every year before the state pension is taken into account. Today&rsquo;s average state pension income of &pound;6,656 would bring their annual shortfall down to &pound;2,299 in retirement. It means that the typical person is relying on the state pension to fund more than half (53%) of their expected retirement income. Despite the shortfall, 43% of working over-45s feel they are financially &ldquo;fit to retire&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Aviva&rsquo;s findings are especially concerning for those over-45s who are closer to retirement and have less of a window to grow their savings. Worryingly, 29% have not even thought about how much retirement income they will need. Those aged 55-64 are more likely to have neglected the issue (34%) than 45-54s (21%) &ndash; despite having less time to act.&nbsp;However, Aviva&rsquo;s analysis offers hope to over-45s by showing how a modest boost to savings habit can help them build an extra pot of &pound;42,000: an amount which, in today&rsquo;s money, would bridge the remaining &pound;2,299 retirement income gap once the state pension is added to their existing funds.</p>\r\n<p>With auto-enrolment only just reaching smaller companies, two in five over-45s have a company pension (43%). Fewer still have a personal pension or SIPP (30%); far below the 82% with current accounts and 70% with savings accounts. Having savings accounts, ISAs and company pension savings are key indicators of feeling confident about retirement finances. ISAs contribute 11p for every &pound;1 saved by over-45s, but again less than half (46%) use this method of saving. Buy-to-let (BTL) property contributes 19p in every &pound;1 overall: almost as much as ISAs, savings accounts and current accounts combined (20p). But this is an expensive venture: among those who have a BTL property, the typical investment is &pound;126,440.</p>\r\n<p>Clive Bolton, Managing Director of Retirement Solutions, Aviva UK Life, said:</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;These findings should encourage every person still in work to think hard about their retirement finances and which group they fall into: the reasonably fit to retire, the potentially fit to retire or the currently unfit to retire. The pension freedoms have broadened people&rsquo;s financial options in later life &ndash; but they don&rsquo;t guarantee freedom from responsibility when it comes to better planning and improving savings habits.</p>\r\n<p>As things stand, the vast majority of people are in danger of being left short-changed by insufficient savings pots, but with the addition of the state pension, the gap is narrow enough to enable them to take action to close it completely.</p>\r\n<p>Finding additional ways to supplement their savings, such as increasing pension contributions while they are in work, working for longer or taking on a part-time job in retirement, may be enough to help them reach their target income.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Tackling the retirement income shortfall &ndash; what should consumers consider?</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Understand what your total savings pot will provide as retirement income and how this measures up to your expectations.</li>\r\n<li>Consider the diversity of your investments &ndash; could you get better returns by spreading your money around more?</li>\r\n<li>Commit to pensions and make the most of personal and employer contributions.</li>\r\n<li>Consider steps you can take to increase your savings &ndash; whether it is increasing pension contributions, working for longer, or taking on a part-time job in retirement.</li>\r\n<li>Take an active interest in how your savings and investments are performing &ndash; don&rsquo;t let apathy rule your future.</li>\r\n<li>Act sooner rather than later to adjust your strategy and contribute more whenever you can.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong><a href="../../page/pensions" target="_blank">Banner Jones Wealth Management LLP</a> wish to help you understand the issues and provide you with advice.&nbsp; Please contact us by phone on&nbsp;<a href="tel:+441246560570">01246 560570</a>&nbsp;or by email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@bannerjoneswm.co.uk">info@bannerjoneswm.co.uk</a>.&nbsp;We would be delighted to help.</strong></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<sub> Sources: www.aviva.co.uk (Article: 2015/07/18)&nbsp;</sub>', '2015-08-12', '83_iStock_000007854419XSmall.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 99712, '2015-09-08 16:00:56', '', '2015-08-20 08:56:24', '2015-09-08 16:02:03', 2, 2, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin'),

No matter how hurt and angry you may feel today, <em>one day you will feel optimistic again.</em> When that day comes you will want to look back and see that you at least <em>tried</em> to act with dignity.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>Try to keep some sort of perspective. </strong>Divorce can feel all-consuming. ''Coming up for air'' by getting out and about, seeing your friends, keeping up an old hobby or starting a new one, or ''having a laugh'' can all help. It might be hard to find time to do this when you are in the middle of re-organising your family, but you might make wiser decisions if you keep a window open onto the ''bigger-picture.''</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>&nbsp;<strong>Make sure you know your legal rights.</strong> (I''m not just saying this because I''m writing for a solicitor&rsquo;s website!) In over 25 years of couples-counselling I have noticed that intelligent, well-meaning people can be strangely reluctant to find out about their legal position. It''s almost as if they believe that <em>knowing where they stand</em> will somehow <em>bring about</em> a separation. It doesn''t. Simply knowing the bottom-line cannot cause anything to happen. It <em>can</em> help people feel less anxious about their choices. Knowledge is power.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Bay</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Acknowledge your emotions. </strong>Divorce can be one of the most painful experiences you ever go through.&nbsp; At times people may feel too angry, guilty, or distressed to be able to think straight.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s also a time when we have decisions to make.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s important to acknowledge our emotions, so that we can recognise them and then set them to one side at the times when we need to be rational decision makers.&nbsp; If we ignore or deny them, they can affect our choices without our realising.&nbsp; So here are a few suggestions on how to accept and acknowledge our emotions.<br /><br /><strong>- </strong>Talk with trusted friends and family about how you feel.&nbsp; It is important to find people who will empathise and provide comfort when you are feeling overwhelmed. <br /><br />- Accept that your ex may be at a different stage on their emotional journey from you.&nbsp; If you were the one who initiated the split, you will probably have been thinking about splitting up for much longer than your partner.<br /><br />- Allow your children, if you have them, to express their emotions too.&nbsp; By letting them know we are subject to painful emotions, we show them it&rsquo;s OK to feel not-OK.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Find new ways to communicate with your ex.</strong> If you have children together and need to remain in regular contact to share childcare, you will need to remain in touch with each other.&nbsp; Even if there are no children, many divorced couples need to remain in touch for some time after separating, because of family, connections and history that has been shared together. <br /><br />- Be prepared to share the big decisions about your future and your family&rsquo;s, and to do this in a businesslike way.<br /><br />- Note down in advance the points that you need to cover, keeping them as simple and depersonalised as possible.<br /><br />- Establish the habit of closing down any conversations that turn into shouting matches or where you are constantly interrupted.&nbsp; Just acknowledge that you are feeling too emotional to continue, and agree to speak again when things have calmed down.<br /><br />- Make use of a professional, such as a couple&rsquo;s counsellor or a mediator, if you and your ex are having difficulties communicating about major decisions.&nbsp; As we have already noted, divorces are an emotional journey, and many divorcing couples have benefited from having an unbiased professional to help.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Allow yourself to grieve. </strong>It can be helpful to view divorce as a type of bereavement.&nbsp; Many people will have heard of the 5 stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.&nbsp; What is not always understood is that these stages do not happen in a fixed order: really they are not so much stages as symptoms that come and go as we adjust to change.&nbsp; It is natural to want to feel OK again as soon as possible after any kind of major loss, but unfortunately human beings take time to heal.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></strong>- Make changes in your life. &nbsp;Create new habits and try different ways of doing things.&nbsp; This will help you to let go of the past.&nbsp; Are there activities you have not been doing because your partner didn&rsquo;t enjoy them, or because with a family you didn&rsquo;t have the time?&nbsp; Maybe now is the time to start or restart some of those. <br /><br />- Consider your longer terms goals.&nbsp; Think about your life 10 years from now and what you want your life to be like at that point<br /><br />- Say goodbye to the relationship.&nbsp; You may wish to remain on friendly terms, but your relationship has changed, and it can be helpful to acknowledge that change with some form of goodbye, whether this is a private ritual, a get-together or a get-away.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../assets/articles/373/contained_images/01e589e9c709_467_shutterstock_195656321.jpg?1440068754" border="0" alt="adult shoes with child''s shoes in the middle, separated by a crack in the ground" hspace="0" width="250" /></p>\r\n<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do you have any other dos and don&rsquo;ts for dealing with divorce?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Mary</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Don''t try to socialise with your ex too early.</strong> Well-meaning people sometimes want to stay friends with their ex-partners. This is perfectly possible, and worth trying, especially if you have children (or interest-groups) in common. However, many people try to do this too soon, with the result that it takes one or both of them much longer to heal. It works better to allow a time when contact is kept to a minimum. When you have both started to get over your divorce, then your friendship stands more of a chance.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li><strong>Sometimes people find it necessary to live in the same house, or to work in the same place during their divorce</strong>. I do know of people who have made this work, but it is a tough thing to attempt. People can become seriously distressed. Usually, the sooner this sort of arrangement can come to an end, the better. If you are living in the same property because you are waiting for your house to sell, work together to bring this about. Similarly, it can be difficult when people are divorcing partners they work with. It can help to make an agreement about ''boundaries'' during your working hours.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t treat texting your ex as an addiction!</strong> If you are in the process of divorcing, it can help to place a limit on how often you and your partner text each other. Texts don''t have a ''tone of voice'' and can be easily misunderstood, especially if you are both stressed. Emotions don''t come across very well by text, and can cause a lot of unnecessary bad feeling. Agree to text only when you have something urgent or practical to say. This will help you keep a clear head.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li><strong>Do communicate carefully.</strong> Think how important communication is when things are going well, then think how very much more important it is to communicate calmly and effectively when things are going badly!&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Bay</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t confuse empathy with advice.</strong>&nbsp; As you go through your divorce, you will probably receive advice from friends and family.&nbsp; Be aware that their input may also be coloured by their anger or sadness on your behalf.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t withdraw from social contact.</strong>&nbsp; Although everybody sometimes wants to have time alone with themselves, withdrawing can lead to feeling stuck and depressed.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t close the channels of communication with your children, if you have them.</strong>&nbsp; It may be that they are angry with one or both partners during and throughout the process, and they may stay angry for what feels like a long time.&nbsp; <br /><br /></li>\r\n<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t communicate by text when it comes to any but the simplest information.</strong>&nbsp; Texts are both intimate and highly prone to misinterpretation.&nbsp; Email, telephone or face to face tend to work better.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t expect new systems for sharing childcare and arranging access to work perfectly straight away.</strong>&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t possibly know how things will work out, so be prepared to trial a few different arrangements before you settle on any one system.&nbsp; <br /><br /></li>\r\n<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t use children, or other family members to relay information to your ex.</strong>&nbsp; Not only does it put an additional burden on them, but you can&rsquo;t be sure how accurately information will be relayed.&nbsp; Your relationship with your ex may already be fraught enough, without this additional potential for misunderstanding.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t retain the habit of blame.</strong> Try and frame your thoughts and discussions differently, focusing on what needs of yours and your ex&rsquo;s the relationship was failing to meet, rather than who was to blame for the divorce.<br /><br /></li>\r\n<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t hold on to old patterns of mutual support with your ex.</strong>&nbsp; If you need help, advice or expertise that previously they would have provided, ask someone else. And if your ex asks or expects your assistance with something, you will be helping them and yourself to move on if you say &lsquo;no&rsquo;.&nbsp; This is a process of redrawing the boundaries of your relationship, and is an important aspect of accepting the marriage is over.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>At Banner Jones we encourage counselling as a natural and healthy aid to getting through difficult times in your life.

(378, '“Markets can fall as well as rise…”', 'Never was that statement truer than in August, when virtually all the major world markets headed down, led by the plunging stock market in China.', '<p>Never was that statement truer than in August, when virtually all the major world markets headed down, led by the plunging stock market in China. It became virtually impossible to watch a news bulletin without seeing a shell-shocked fund manager or a weeping Chinese private investor.</p>\r\n<p>It is, however, important that we keep China&rsquo;s dramatic rises and falls in some sort of perspective, and we&rsquo;ve tried to do that in the section on the Far East. If August emphasised anything though, it is that saving and investing is a long term commitment &ndash; not a short term gamble, and if your financial plan is effective and well-constructed, the &lsquo;China Crisis&rsquo;, could be a longer term investment opportunity.</p>\r\n<p>Elsewhere, there was the usual mixture of good and bad news. Let&rsquo;s start the prediction from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research that world growth in 2015 will slow to the lowest level since the financial crisis. It will apparently be down to 3% instead of 3.2%.</p>\r\n<p>The Greek stock market finally re-opened after being closed for five weeks &ndash; and immediately plunged. There was renewed fighting in the Ukraine and &lsquo;tense&rsquo; would be far too mild a word to describe relations between North and South Korea: at one point Kim Jong-un put his troops on a full war footing.</p>\r\n<p>&hellip;But we can just as easily see things the other way. The CBI predicted &lsquo;decent quarterly growth&rsquo; in the UK as it raised its forecasts for this year and next. The Bundesbank described economic growth in Germany as &lsquo;solid&rsquo; &ndash; and figures for the second quarter in the United States were revised sharply upwards, giving a boost to world stock markets when they most needed it.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>UK</strong></h3>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sell in May and go away,&rdquo; as the old time investors used to say &ndash; although that mantra had more to do with spending the summer at Lords, Ascot and Henley than it did with investment. Nevertheless, it would have been sound advice last month, as the UK market followed the rest of the world, falling by 7% in the month to close at 6,248 having briefly dropped below the 6,000 barrier when the chaos in China was at its worst.</p>\r\n<p>So much for the markets: the second part of the old mantra is &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come back until St. Leger day,&rdquo; which is on September 12<sup>th</sup> this year. Maybe we should therefore pay more heed to the CBI&rsquo;s forecast, with growth of 2.6% now expected for this year and 2.8% for next year &ndash; up from the previous forecasts of 2.4% and 2.5% respectively.</p>\r\n<p>In other good news the Council of Mortgage Lenders reported that borrowing was at its highest level since 2008, whilst a report from accountants BDO said the Scottish economy was &ldquo;thriving&rdquo; with pretty much every indicator pointing in the right direction.</p>\r\n<p>There would, however, have been bad news for an independent Scotland, with the Scottish Government&rsquo;s quarterly national accounts showing North Sea oil revenues down sharply. The figures revealed revenue of &pound;742m for the final three months of 2014 &ndash; but only &pound;168m for the first quarter of 2015.</p>\r\n<p>Other bad news saw UK unemployment up by 25,000 for the April to June period &ndash; although there are 354,000 more people in work than a year ago. UK manufacturing growth picked up slightly in July after a record 26 month low in June, although according to the purchasing managers&rsquo; survey it is still &ldquo;near stagnant.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>It was also confirmed that interest rates are still likely to rise, despite the slowdown in China. Outgoing Monetary Policy Committee member Professor David Miles told the BBC that &ldquo;rates will rise soon&rdquo; and later in the month Bank of England Governor Mark Carney confirmed this.</p>\r\n<p>July was at least a good month for Chancellor George Osborne: the government made a surplus in the month thanks to higher tax receipts. Whatever is happening in the rest of the world, we appear to be paying our tax on time&hellip;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Europe</strong></h3>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Never say never&rdquo; as the saying goes &ndash; especially when you&rsquo;re writing about the Greek financial crisis. As reported above, the Greek stock market re-opened and promptly fell sharply, ending the month down 22% at 624. This was despite a third bailout finally being agreed, with Greece set to receive a further &euro;86bn over the next three years.</p>\r\n<p>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras celebrated the news by resigning, with Greece now set for its fourth general election in less than 3&frac12; years on Sunday, September 20th. Tsipras has told the Greek people that &lsquo;they will judge him.&rsquo; With anti-austerity (and anti-bailout) feeling still running high, the result could well be a very messy coalition.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile the Bundesbank&rsquo;s prediction of steady growth was certainly being born out in Germany, with the June figures confirming a record trade surplus of &euro;24bn &ndash; up from &euro;16.2bn a year previously and well ahead of market expectations. GDP growth was 0.4% for the second quarter of the year, with unemployment holding steady at 4.7% and inflation doing likewise at 0.2%.</p>\r\n<p>&hellip;But not even the German stock market could escape the wind blowing from China. The index was down 9% to finish August at 10,259: the other major European market, France, fell almost as much, ending the month down 8% at 4,653.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>US</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Whatever was happening in the rest of the world there was at least good news for Facebook, as the company revealed that it had reached the landmark of 1bn users in a single day &ndash; roughly equal to 1 in 7 of the world&rsquo;s population.</p>\r\n<p>There was more general good news as the economy added a further 215,000 jobs in July, but the real boost came at the end of the month, after revised figures showed that the US economy grew by far more than had been thought between April and June.</p>\r\n<p>The economy grew at an annualised rate of 3.7% &ndash; up from the first estimate of 2.3% &ndash; with more corporate investment adding to stronger consumer and government spending. This gave an immediate boost to both oil and share prices.</p>\r\n<p>All this made the case for a September rise in interest rates &ldquo;less compelling&rdquo; according to Federal Reserve official William Dudley &ndash; but it still wasn&rsquo;t enough to prevent the Dow Jones index falling sharply in the month, down 7% to 16,528 at the end of August.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Far East</strong></h3>\r\n<p>As we mentioned in the introduction, it&rsquo;s important to try and keep this month&rsquo;s chaos on the Chinese stock market in perspective: let&rsquo;s try and do that.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of August 2013 the Shanghai Composite index stood at 2,098. Ten months later, at the end of June 2014, it had fallen slightly to 2,048. It then began a dramatic rise, closing August 2014 at 2,217 and ending the year at 3,235. The index raced ahead through the early months of 2015, and in&nbsp; May it had just closed the month at 4,613. Since then it has tumbled dramatically, falling to 3,664 at the end of July and a further 12% in August to end the month at 3,207 (having been below 3,000 at one point during the month).</p>\r\n<p>But this is where we need to take a long view: on a 12 month basis the Chinese market is up 44%: over two years it is up by 53%. By any standards those are outstanding returns &ndash; and as we said in the introduction, saving and investing is emphatically a long term commitment.</p>\r\n<p>Clearly though, the Chinese economy is slowing down: exports were down by 8% in July and all the news regarding factory output is negative. The Government sought to boost exports by devaluing the yuan against the dollar &ndash; describing it as a &lsquo;one-off depreciation.&rsquo; They promptly then did exactly the same on the following two days, triggering fears of a currency war as India, for example, immediately sought to weaken the rupee.</p>\r\n<p>As several commentators pointed out, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s good for growth in China is unfortunately bad for everyone else.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Inevitably the bad news and uncertainty from China affected other stock markets in the region. Hong Kong followed the lead of the Shanghai Composite, dropping by 12% in August to 21,671. Japan was down by 8% to 18,890 but South Korea &ndash; despite the belligerence of its neighbour to the North &ndash; was only down by 4%, the market ending August at 1,941.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Emerging Markets</strong></h3>\r\n<p>China had a rival in the &lsquo;bad news stakes&rsquo; with August proving to be a dreadful month for the Brazilian economy. Figures for June confirmed a rise in unemployment to 7.5% &ndash; higher than the forecast of 7.05% and the worst for five years. Inflation (pushed up by rising electricity prices) was at a 12 year high of 9.56% compared to the official target of 4.5% and the IMF confirmed that it expected the economy to shrink by 1.5% this year.</p>\r\n<p>In India there were indications that official figures would show growth slowing in the second quarter of the year and this &ndash; combined with China &ndash; was enough to send the stock market down 7% in August to close at 26,283.</p>\r\n<p>No such gloom in Russia though as it registered the only rise in the month. Despite the economy contracting by 4.6% from April to June and an eye-watering inflation rate of 15.6% the stock market rose by 4% in August. It closed the month at 1,733 and is now up by 24% in 2015. Unsurprisingly the stock market was down 8% to 46,626.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>And finally&hellip;</strong></h3>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure whether this story is humorous or tragic, but August saw Russian Premier Vladimir Putin decide to ban imports of several Western foods, presumably in retaliation for sanctions. The authorities began the campaign by bulldozing a &lsquo;mountain&rsquo; of European cheese, which had officially been branded a security threat.</p>\r\n<p>Boxes of subversive bacon were also tossed into the incinerators in a move condemned by many both inside and outside Russia &ndash; a country where poverty rates are soaring and memories remain of the Soviet-era famines.</p>\r\n<p>The ban is currently in place until August of next year and covers a wide range of food including pork, beef, fish and seafood, milk and dairy products, fruits, vegetables and nuts.</p>\r\n<p>From Russia to China, &lsquo;nuts&rsquo; might just be the right word to sum up August&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<hr />\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Written by Jill Thomas of Banner Jones Wealth Management.</p>\r\n<p><strong>For more information, or to arange an appointment you can contact us&nbsp;by phone on&nbsp;<a href="tel:+441246560570">01246 560570</a>&nbsp;or by email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@bannerjoneswm.co.uk">info@bannerjoneswm.co.uk</a>.</strong></p>', '2015-09-09', '227_EMPLOYMENT_ASSIST_LOGO.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 634983, '2015-09-08 16:01:26', '', '2015-09-08 16:01:27', '2015-09-08 16:01:27', 2, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'admin');

(1, 'Are ''Flat-Pack'' Homes The Solution To The Housing Shortage?', '“Flat-pack” houses could end Britain’s housing crisis which is pushing property prices beyond many first-time buyers’ reach, causing them to abandon hopes of home ownership.', '<p>&ldquo;Flat-pack&rdquo; houses could end Britain&rsquo;s housing crisis which is pushing property prices beyond many first-time buyers&rsquo; reach, causing them to abandon hopes of home ownership.</p>\r\n<p>Embracing &ldquo;modular homes&rdquo;, where large parts of a property are manufactured in factories and then transported to building sites for final assembly, would speed up house building, according to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imeche.org/" target="_blank">Institution of Mechanical Engineers</a>&nbsp;(IME).</p>\r\n<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/11716733/www.imeche.org/docs/default-source/position-statements/uk-house-building-manufacturing-affordable-quality-homes-policy-statemen.pdf?sfvrsn=0" target="_blank">new report</a>&nbsp;the body argues that modular homes would help the UK build the 250,000 new homes needed each year for the next two decades as the population booms, compared with the current rate of about 120,000.</p>\r\n<p>Dr Tim Fox, author of the IME study, called for the Government to support off-site construction technology with incentives, saying that as well as providing a greater number of homes because modular construction is faster, they also deliver more environmentally friendly properties.</p>\r\n<p>More efficient, modern construction in factories rather than using bricks and mortar on site means modular homes use fewer resources to build and are more energy efficient once completed.</p>\r\n<p>As well as delivering cheaper homes, flat-pack homes could also boost the country&rsquo;s manufacturing and skills base, the IME added.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The UK is in the middle of an acute housing crisis,&rdquo; said Dr Fox. &ldquo;The Government needs to demonstrate real ambition, leadership and innovation, not make small piecemeal changes, if it is going to solve the UK&rsquo;s housing crisis. Overhauling the way the UK constructs homes could be the quickest and most effective way of doing this.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>He added that modular construction has moved on since post-war prefabricated homes and controversial &ldquo;system-built&rdquo; houses of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>\r\n<p>Changing the way Britain build its homes won the support of the Home Builders Federation (HBF), which said Britain is a among the world''s leaders in the modular construction.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is not just about making prefabs anymore,&rdquo; said a HBF spokesman. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s manufacturing process that is very high quality and brings great advantages. Anything we can do to solve the housing crisis is needed and this is just one way of speeding up the construction process.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href="../../team_members/36">Chris Sellars<br /></a></strong>Solicitor, Executive Director, Head of Residential Property Services</p>\r\n<p>Banner Jones Solicitors<br />24 Glumangate<br />Chesterfield<br />Tel 01246 560560<br />Fax 01246 220390<br />Email:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@bannerjones.co.uk">info@bannerjones.co.uk</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/BannerJonesSolicitors" target="_blank"><img src="../../../assets/articles/368/contained_images/65cc94c2d802_449_rsz_facebook.png?1436458081" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="26" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://plus.google.com/+bannerjones" target="_blank"><img src="../../../assets/articles/368/contained_images/08e9d81a3b98_444_rsz_googleplus.png?1436280698" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="26" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/1134191" target="_blank"><img src="../../../assets/articles/368/contained_images/1dd408cd3426_445_rsz_linkedin.png?1436280705" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="26" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/bannerjones" target="_blank"><img src="../../../assets/articles/368/contained_images/54fe569ec084_447_rsz_twitter.png?1436280719" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="26" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxXn4FxKr5OyKwcbhlekSwg" target="_blank"><img src="../../../assets/articles/368/contained_images/1f5c4638019c_450_YouTube.jpeg?1436520453" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="26" /></a></p>', '2015-07-07', '401_SellarsMarket.png', 'image/png', 202466, '2015-07-13 14:37:39', '', '2015-07-13 14:37:40', '2015-07-15 11:44:22', 2, 2, 0, NULL, 1, 0),

Figures showed the number of borrowers taking mortgages to buy homes reached a 15-month high in June.', '<p>...or at least so said the high street banks last Friday. Figures showed the number of borrowers taking mortgages to buy homes reached a 15-month high in June. The figures came ahead of a Treasury announcement that six providers had signed up to offer it''s help to buy Isa from December &ndash; the latest strand in the government&rsquo;s efforts to help first-time buyers keep up with rising prices.</p>\r\n<p>Together with the end of political uncertainty following the election, fierce competition among mortgage lenders has driven rates to record lows, and this seems to have renewed homebuyers&rsquo; confidence, and encouraged remortgaging. A total of 44,488 loans were taken out for house purchases in June, an uplift of 8% on the same month in 2014 and above the previous six-month average of 39,340.</p>\r\n<p>The total number of approvals was almost 10,000 more than the six-month average, as Richard Woolhouse, chief economist at the British Bankers Association said: &ldquo;The housing market is beginning to hot up again, with a pick-up in the number of mortgage approvals for the last month.</p>\r\n<p>Interestingly, we&rsquo;ve also seen an increase in the number of people remortgaging, which could be down to savvy borrowers taking advantage of competitive deals on fixed-rate mortgages ahead of a possible rise in interest rates. There are some great deals out there; for instance First Direct are offering a lifetime tracker at 1.99% over base rate ie 2.49%. If interest rates go up the mortgage will just match the base rate rise, not any other rise in mortgage rates.</p>\r\n<p>The figures are for a period <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/16/uk-interest-rate-rise-new-year">before the Bank of England governor&rsquo;s recent warning that interest rates could rise at the turn of the year</a>, which is likely to prompt more borrowers to consider locking in at current low rates.</p>\r\n<p>Anecdotally, the first rate rise is the trigger point for many people remortgaging but it may even be the second or third increase, as that is when there is a significant impact on a household&rsquo;s expenditure and people then remortgage to &lsquo;save&rsquo; money. However, by then the best fixed rates will have long gone.</p>\r\n<p>For would-be buyers, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/mar/18/how-will-osbornes-help-to-buy-isa-work-for-first-time-buyers">the help to buy Isa</a> will offer a government payment of &pound;50 for every &pound;200 saved by each person, up to a maximum of &pound;3,000, or &pound;6,000 for couples who buy together. The Treasury said the Isa would be available from 1 December, with Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide, NatWest, Santander, and Virgin Money already committed to offering the accounts.</p>\r\n<p>The chancellor, George Osborne, said he was &ldquo;delighted&rdquo; that so many providers had signed up. &ldquo;This government is determined to help working people, and encouraging the aspiration to home ownership is central to that,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p>The accounts, which will be available for four years and can be used at any point, are available to all first-time buyers and can be used alongside other government schemes.</p>\r\n<p>Research by Halifax suggests savers will need all the help they can get. It found that the average price paid for homes bought through both parts of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jun/15/help-to-buy-locks-out-first-time-buyers-house-prices">Help-to-buy</a> and the shared ownership scheme has hit &pound;190,000 &ndash; only 4% less than the average amount for ordinary house prices. The lender said the schemes were helping younger buyers, with a third of those using them aged 20 to 29.</p>\r\n<p>With Mark Carney&rsquo;s announcement that base rate is likely to rise in the near future, these low rates will not be around for long. Borrowers still sitting on their SVR or coming to the end of a fixed mortgage deal need to act fast to secure a low rate.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href="../../team_members/36">Chris Sellars<br /></a></strong>Solicitor, Executive Director, Head of Residential Property Services</p>\r\n<p>Banner Jones Solicitors<br />24 Glumangate<br />Chesterfield<br />Tel 01246 560560<br />Fax 01246 220390<br />Email:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@bannerjones.co.uk">info@bannerjones.co.uk</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/BannerJonesSolicitors" target="_blank"><img src="../../../assets/articles/368/contained_images/65cc94c2d802_449_rsz_facebook.png?1436458081" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="26" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://plus.google.com/+bannerjones" target="_blank"><img src="../../../assets/articles/368/contained_images/08e9d81a3b98_444_rsz_googleplus.png?1436280698" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="26" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/1134191" target="_blank"><img src="../../../assets/articles/368/contained_images/1dd408cd3426_445_rsz_linkedin.png?1436280705" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="26" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/bannerjones" target="_blank"><img src="../../../assets/articles/368/contained_images/54fe569ec084_447_rsz_twitter.png?1436280719" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="26" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxXn4FxKr5OyKwcbhlekSwg" target="_blank"><img src="../../../assets/articles/368/contained_images/1f5c4638019c_450_YouTube.jpeg?1436520453" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="26" /></a></p>', '2015-08-06', '401_SellarsMarket.png', 'image/png', 202466, '2015-08-10 09:15:42', '', '2015-08-10 09:15:44', '2015-08-10 09:15:44', 2, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0),

The legislation was passed in 1980 and was a response to a rise in incomes, argues Professor Colin Jones at Heriot-Watt University&rsquo;s School of The Built Environment: &ldquo;Rising incomes meant that more people were demanding home ownership and so some sort of scheme was inevitable. There was also none of the supply-side problem we have today, so councils felt perfectly comfortable selling off the stock.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Supply was so abundant that, even adjusting for general inflation, properties were mostly selling at less than their rebuilding cost.</p>\r\n<p>More than a third of property wealth in the UK is now owned by households where at least one occupant is 65 or older, and nearly one in 10 (9%) of 55- to 64-year-olds live in households with net property wealth of &pound;500,000 or more; the highest of any age group, says the <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/was/wealth-in-great-britain-wave-3/2010-2012/report--chapter-3--property-wealth.html?format=print">ONS</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Already, <a href="http://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/comms/r96.pdf">28% of those aged 22 to 30 years of age</a> have been forced to remain at their family home, or move back.

Meanwhile the CHS warned of a &ldquo;perfect storm&rdquo; where older, already privileged homeowners buy and rent homes to those priced out of ownership.</p>\r\n<p>Many people in the baby boomer generation will struggle to recognise themselves in this description of an asset-rich, privileged few. A sizeable number of retirees shoulder financial responsibility for both their adult children and elderly parents. Research from the Equity Release Council (ERC) shows that over-55s contributed around &pound;26.7bn to support children and grandchildren last year.

Proposals in the DCLG&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tackling rogue landlords and improving the private rental sector&rdquo; paper include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A blacklist of rogue landlords and letting agents.</li>\r\n<li>Minimum fines for repeat offences and rent repayment orders.</li>\r\n<li>New powers for local authorities to seize private rentals.</li>\r\n<li>A &ldquo;fit and proper person&rdquo; test for landlords.</li>\r\n<li>New civil penalties and fines against landlords for overcrowding, damp, disrepair and vermin infestations.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The proposals come amid growing concern over the state of the private rented sector. The DCLG said 84% of private renters are satisfied with their accommodation, but that a small number of rogue landlords are causing &ldquo;acute and complex problems&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>When the government gave &pound;6.7m to a few local authorities to inspect 40,000 privately rented properties, they found 3,000 were so poor that enforcement action or prosecution were required.</p>\r\n<p>Magistrates are, in theory, able to impose unlimited fines against landlords but, in practice, the average is just &pound;1,500 as the courts have to take into account the means of the offender. It found that one landlord was fined less than &pound;1,500 for operating an unlicensed HMO (house in multiple occupation) that was &ldquo;severely overcrowded and in extremely poor condition&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Rent repayment orders were introduced in 2004 but few have been issued. The DCLG is suggesting a wider definition of the law, which could mean that a landlord who fails to comply with local authority orders on things such as damp could be forced to repay all the rent they have received.</p>\r\n<p>But it is the proposals for new civil penalties that could have the biggest impact on landlords. Prosecutions are rare as few local authorities have the resources to take landlords to court. But civil penalties (along the lines of parking tickets) could be issued without recourse to the courts and applied easily and widely.</p>\r\n<p>The DCLG said civil penalties could be issued against landlords and letting agents who permit overcrowding and let properties fall into disrepair, as well as for poor sanitation, electrical faults, damp and vermin infestation. Fines could be as high as &pound;5,000.</p>\r\n<p>The campaign group Generation Rent has welcomed many of the proposals. A spokesman says: &ldquo;It was a shame the immigration checks led the coverage as there are a number of policies the government is proposing that we have been calling for, such as sharing tenancy deposit data to help with enforcement, the ability for councils to levy fines they can keep and expanding rent repayment orders. These will make it easier for authorities to target criminal landlords, easier to bring them to justice and easier to protect tenants from unsafe housing&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>But letting agents say the new regulations will be just another burden on legitimate businesses and will fail to catch persistent offenders.</p>\r\n<p>Others initiatives to control rogue landlords or improve practices have largely flopped, say critics.</p>\r\n<p>A scheme launched by the London mayor, <a href="http://twitter.com/MayorofLondon" target="_blank">Boris Johnson</a>, to improve the standard of rented property in the capital was branded a flop after it was found just that 0.2% of adverts for homes to let mentioned that the landlord or letting agent had signed up.</p>\r\n<p>Since October last year, letting agents have been required to tell tenants about which ombudsman redress scheme they have joined, but many have failed to sign up and have faced little or no enforcement action.</p>\r\n<p>A spokesman for the Association of Residential Letting Agents says: &ldquo;We are staunch advocates of any moves to improve standards in the private rented sector and welcome the consultation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href="../../team_members/36">Chris Sellars<br /></a></strong>Solicitor, Executive Director, Head of Residential Property Department</p>\r\n<p>Banner Jones Solicitors<br />24 Glumangate<br />Chesterfield<br />Tel 01246 560560<br />Fax 01246 220390<br />Email:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@bannerjones.co.uk">info@bannerjones.co.uk</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/BannerJonesSolicitors" target="_blank"><img src="../../../assets/articles/368/contained_images/65cc94c2d802_449_rsz_facebook.png?1436458081" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="26" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://plus.google.com/+bannerjones" target="_blank"><img src="../../../assets/articles/368/contained_images/08e9d81a3b98_444_rsz_googleplus.png?1436280698" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="26" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/1134191" target="_blank"><img src="../../../assets/articles/368/contained_images/1dd408cd3426_445_rsz_linkedin.png?1436280705" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="26" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/bannerjones" target="_blank"><img src="../../../assets/articles/368/contained_images/54fe569ec084_447_rsz_twitter.png?1436280719" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="26" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxXn4FxKr5OyKwcbhlekSwg" target="_blank"><img src="../../../assets/articles/368/contained_images/1f5c4638019c_450_YouTube.jpeg?1436520453" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="26" /></a></p>', '2015-08-26', '401_SellarsMarket.png', 'image/png', 202466, '2015-08-26 09:00:00', '', '2015-08-26 09:00:01', '2015-08-26 09:00:01', 2, NULL, 0, NULL, 1, 0);

Grantino</strong>. This case went to the highest court in the land, The Supreme Court, purely on whether a pre-nuptial agreement entered into by the parties in Germany three months before they married was applicable in law in England and Wales.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Supreme Court decided in October 2010 that it was natural to infer that parties entering into agreements of this sort will intend that legal effect would be given to those agreements. Unless the outcome of the pre-nuptial agreement was unfair to any children of the marriage, in which case the court could still ignore or vary the agreement, the agreement would be upheld by the court.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;">How do I found out more?</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Please contact any member of the family team who would be able to discuss the options available with you.</p>', '2010-11-15 10:35:37', '2014-02-12 14:20:59', '', '', 1, 1, 0, NULL, 1, 0, '<p>Contacts us today to get your agreement in place</p>', '58_iStock_000000753188XSmall.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 144736, '2011-03-04 16:11:24', '', 'family_highlight', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', 'PartnershipAgreements.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 42618, '2011-01-13 14:49:43', 'Pre or Postmarital/Partnership Agreements', '', '', 'Pre or Postmarital/Partnership Agreements', '/web/contact_us', '', NULL, 'family_highlight', '', '/web/contact_us', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', 0, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Without a Will the government decides these things for you.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Read our <a href="../../../assets/stored_documents/original/14_Factsheet - 10 Reasons why you need a Will.doc?1322580008" target="_blank">free guide</a>&nbsp;now which will give you 10 reasons why you should have a Will.</h2>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Why Use Banner Jones?</h2>\r\n<ul style="text-align: left;">\r\n<li>Highly regarded team of qualified Wills solicitors</li>\r\n<li>FREE secure Will storage for life</li>\r\n<li>Members of ''the Certainty'' national Will register</li>\r\n<li>Appointments not always necessary</li>\r\n<li>Quick turnaround</li>\r\n<li>Home visits available</li>\r\n<li>Witnesses provided</li>\r\n<li>We''ll give you tax advice as part of the process</li>\r\n<li>Fixed Fee Promise on all Wills</li>\r\n<li>We will cover every detail leaving you able to relax</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>For more information about Wills, or to arrange an appointment, call <span class="calltracks_bannerjonescouk-main">0330 017 6309</span></strong>*<strong>&nbsp;or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@bannerjones.co.uk">info@bannerjones.co.uk</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p>*<strong><sub>calls cost no more than a local 01 number and are included in your mobile minutes.</sub></strong></p>', '2010-11-15 10:53:07', '2015-07-22 11:11:19', '', '', 1, 1, 0, NULL, 1, 0, '<p>Solicitors are insured and regulated.</p>\r\n<p>Will writers are not.</p>\r\n<p>Protect your family properly</p>', '84_iStock_000007985661XSmall.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 174578, '2011-03-04 16:19:43', 'Wills solicitor chesterfield and sheffield', 'family_highlight', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', 'Wills.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 51009, '2011-01-12 13:00:19', 'Wills', '', '', 'Wills', '/page/making-a-will', '', 9, 'family_highlight', '<p>Register your Will today</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our Wills now include FREE registration on the national Will register, Certainty</p>', '/page/making-a-will', '', 'CertaintyNewLogo.JPG', 'image/jpeg', 44741, '2012-06-12 12:16:56', 'wills solicitor chesterfield and sheffield', 0, '<p><a href="../../../assets/stored_documents/original/61_Family - Wills 2011 - Updated 07.04.14.pdf?1396883400" target="_blank">Download Banner Jones Wills Leaflet</a></p>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/stored_images/original/260_Family - Wills 2011.png?1396885003" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" width="250" /></p>', '', ''),

(67, 'Inheritance Tax', 'inheritance_tax', 'Inheritance Tax -The Facts | Probate Solicitors in Sheffield | Banner Jones', 67, 0, 0, 1, '2010-04-29 08:55:42', '<p style="text-align: left;">Currently Inheritance Tax is a tax payable on death at the rate of 40% on the value of your net assets over &pound;325,000. The first &pound;325,000 is called the Nil Rate Band because although it is taxable to Inheritance Tax, it is taxed at 0%.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">If you are married, the best way to pay less inheritance tax (or even none at all) is by making inheritance tax efficient Wills. We can help you do this.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Here are some Frequently Asked Questions:</p>\r\n<h3 style="text-align: left;">1. Can&rsquo;t I just give some assets away, so I leave less than the Nil Rate Band when I die?</h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">If you give away large amounts of money, or valuable assets whilst you are alive, you must survive this gift for 7 years otherwise the Inland Revenue will tax you as if you still owned them when you die. This is the case whether you make the gift to an individual or put it into some types of trust.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">If you put your money or assets into certain types of trust or give them to a company, however, there is an immediate charge to inheritance tax &ndash; even though you are still alive.</p>\r\n<h3 style="text-align: left;">2. So, I can&rsquo;t give anything away whilst I am alive unless I survive for 7 years?</h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">There are certain gifts you can make which are not subject to this 7 year rule. Everyone has an &ldquo;annual exemption&rdquo; for inheritance tax of &pound;3,000 each every tax year. That means you can give away &pound;3,000 in total every tax year and it immediately falls out of your estate for inheritance tax purposes. If you die within 7 years, that gift will not be brought back into account. If you haven&rsquo;t used your annual exemption one year, you can roll it forward for 1 tax year, so you can give away &pound;6,000 the next year. You can only do this once, however.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">All gifts to UK charity, registered housing associations, qualifying political parties, national museums and universities are also exempt form inheritance tax altogether, whether you give to them under your Will or during your lifetime.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">If your children or grandchildren get married, you can give them or their new spouse a lump sum of &pound;5,000 or &pound;2,500 respectively, completely free of inheritance tax.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">You can give any amount to your own spouse free of inheritance tax (provided you are both domiciled in England and Wales) although you should seek legal advice before doing so, as this could affect other tax planning possibilities.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">There are other gifts which are exempt from inheritance tax &ndash; please telephone or call into one of our offices to arrange an appointment and we will be happy to discuss these further.</p>\r\n<h3 style="text-align: left;">3. If I do decide to give a large amount to my children now, is there anything I can do to reduce the tax?</h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">You can insure the inheritance tax liability which would arise if you were to die within 7 years of the gift. Please ask for more information and one of our specialist advisers will be delighted to explain how this works and, if you wish, put you in touch with a trusted financial expert to help you choose the right policy for you.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>For more information Inheritance Tax, or to arrange an appointment with an expert, call <span class="calltracks_bannerjonescouk-main">0330 017 6309</span></strong>*<strong>&nbsp;or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@bannerjones.co.uk">info@bannerjones.co.uk</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">*<strong><sub>calls cost no more than a local 01 number and are included in your mobile minutes.</sub></strong></p>', '2010-11-15 10:57:46', '2015-07-22 11:19:12', '', '', 1, 1, 0, NULL, 1, 0, '<p>For more FREE information on Trusts and Inheritance Tax please click here</p>', '78_iStock_000006000433XSmall.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 189291, '2011-03-04 16:21:53', '', 'family_highlight', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', 'InheritanceTax.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 35556, '2011-01-11 11:47:27', 'Inheritance Tax', '', '', 'Inheritance Tax', '', 'http://www.lawdonut.co.uk/law/personal-law/family-trusts-and-inheritance-tax/?s=BAN082', 9, 'family_highlight', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', 0, '<p><a href="../../../assets/stored_documents/original/61_Family - Wills 2011 - Updated 07.04.14.pdf?1396883400" target="_blank">Download Banner Jones Wills Leaflet</a></p>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/stored_images/original/260_Family - Wills 2011.png?1396885003" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="250" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '', ''),

This costs on average around &pound;450 per week which means that the money you worked so hard for all your life can soon be eaten away. There are ways to preserve your assets and that&rsquo;s where we can help.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">If your total assets (usually including the value of your home) exceed &pound;23,250&nbsp;&nbsp;then you will have to pay the care fees yourself, until your assets fall below that level (when the local authority will step in and contribute some of the cost). Certain assets are disregarded (see below) but the best way to prevent all your assets being used up by long term care fees is to come and see us at an early stage.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">We specialise in Lifetime Planning &ndash; that is, we help people of all ages plan their future. We work closely with other professionals and the local authority to help people achieve their goals and to make sure there are no nasty surprises along the way.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">So how can we make sure you hang on to your assets?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; NHS funding</strong><br />The NHS has to fund all or part of the cost of care in some circumstances. We can explain this in detail and liaise with the NHS funding authorities on your behalf.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2.&nbsp; Make use of disregarded property</strong><br />Some types of assets are disregarded by the local authority when assessing your capital. This includes the value of your home if your partner, a relative over 60 or a relative under 60 who is mentally or physically disabled still lives there when you go into care. It also includes personal belongings, such as jewellery or cars. If you wish to rely on any property being disregarded it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">vital</span> that you talk to us first, to make sure that it complies with the rules.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>3.&nbsp; Give away an asset</strong><br /><strong>WARNING: </strong>You cannot just give away an asset for these purposes. If you give something away and one of your reasons for doing so is to avoid care fees, the &ldquo;notional capital&rdquo; rules mean that you will be assessed as still owning that asset even after you give it away. You<strong> MUST</strong> see a solicitor before giving any assets away &ndash; however large or small. We can also tell you if there are any unforeseen tax or other implications of giving things away.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">We recommend that you come to us as soon as you retire &ndash; or even earlier. We can then discuss giving assets away in the context of a long term plan. We can advise on types of trust available to you or alternatives to giving away the asset.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>4.&nbsp; Financial planning</strong><br />We work closely with independent financial advisers who specialise in long term care fees planning. There are many different products available, from bonds to insurance policies, which can help to preserve your assets. We would be happy to introduce you to a financial adviser and arrange a 3-way meeting with you, them and us. That way you know that your panel of experts are all working together in your best interests.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>For more information, or to arrange an appointment, call <span class="calltracks_bannerjonescouk-main">0330 017 6309</span></strong>*<strong>&nbsp;or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@bannerjones.co.uk">info@bannerjones.co.uk</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p>*<strong><sub>calls cost no more than a local 01 number and are included in your mobile minutes.</sub></strong></p>', '2010-11-15 10:58:54', '2015-03-19 11:45:17', '', '', 1, 2, 0, NULL, 1, 0, '<p>We work with Independent Financial Advisors with specialist care planning&nbsp;qualifications.</p>\r\n<p>This ensures you get&nbsp;a complete package of advice.</p>\r\n<p>For a joint meeting call us today</p>', '108_iStock_000013859617XSmall.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 98164, '2011-03-04 16:35:40', '', 'family_highlight', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', 'LongTermCare.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 54456, '2010-12-22 10:09:58', 'Long-term Care Planning', '', '', 'Long-term Care Planning', '', '', NULL, 'family_highlight', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', 0, '', '', ''),

Both parties and their Collaborative lawyers as well as making a commitment not to go to court, agree to a set of basic ground rules. Negotiations are based upon full financial disclosure, and when needed, other jointly instructed neutral professionals (such as accountants) can be brought in to assist in the process. Solutions are based upon the parties&rsquo; interests and needs rather than conflicting positions. Sometimes only a couple of meetings are needed, sometimes four or five. These meetings can be close together or widely spaced depending upon your individual circumstances. The choice is yours. Once agreement is reached, your Collaborative lawyer will make it binding for you and put the agreement into effect.

Unless you have stated otherwise, this will be 50% each for 2 owners or one third each for 3 owners etc. You are each free to use your share in any way you want. You can give it away during your lifetime, or can leave it to someone under your Will.

As a business grows, over the years a generation gap will more than likely appear.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Typically the 1<sup>st</sup> generation will be one or more close family members, often of a similar age. The 2<sup>nd</sup> generation will be their children and the 3<sup>rd&nbsp;</sup>generation could be the cousins, possibly with a wide range of ages and the family ties not as close as siblings so overall the ownership becomes more fragmented.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Gift of Business</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Some owners come under pressure from the next generation who think that it is their &ldquo;right&rdquo; to be given the business, but in some cases such a Gift may mean that the current generation of owners do not have sufficient funds to retire.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">There are many questions about surrounding gifting the business, such as:</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: left;">\r\n<li>Who do you give shares to?</li>\r\n<li>Do you treat all children equally?</li>\r\n<li>Does fairly mean equally?</li>\r\n<li>What about those who are not involved in the business now?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Are you a custodian for the next generation?</li>\r\n<li>Should you expect to gift the business on? </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">We can help you with the answers to these questions.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Sale of Business</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Selling the business provides the opportunity for the current generation to realise the value and have the funds to retire. It also provides opportunity for the current generation to share proceeds with family members who are not participating in next generation.&nbsp; But how do you agree a fair price? What is affordable? It could open up the opportunity for other non-family management to participate in ownership i.e. a Management Buy Out.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Gradual handover</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">When the current generation of owners accept that it is time to step back, for some businesses a more gradual handover may be appropriate. A gradual handover allows the current owners to be paid out over time which may be better for the business financially and it also gives chance for younger family members to start getting involved in the business.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">You might also consider a transfer of management before ownership. This would allow a balance between outright transfer and retaining some management control. You might want to ensure the next generation have the capability to run the business before handing it over and losing control altogether.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">We can advise you and help you understand when voting control has transferred on a gradual handover.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Other things to consider in Succession planning</h2>\r\n<ul style="text-align: left;">\r\n<li>Every adult should have a Will &ndash; if you own a business then this is essential to plan for unexpected events. If there are minor children involved then consider if the business can continue to be run by trustees in the future?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">A Will is vital if ownership is being transferred gradually.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">IHT advice is also an important of planning.</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: left;">\r\n<li>Articles of Association. These may include Shareholders Agreements, Partnership Agreements and Family Charters.&nbsp; All businesses should consider having an agreement regulating their conduct, family businesses are no different but they also have the option of a family charter.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul style="text-align: left;">\r\n<li>Review Property Ownership. Who owns the business property?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Can the business property be treated as separate to the main business?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">This may provide opportunities for family members to acquire/inherit the property rather than the main business.

More often than not people create Lasting Powers of Attorney in later life when there is a higher chance of mental capacity being lost through dementia for example.&nbsp; However, mental capacity can be lost at any age as a result of say, an accident so we would also advise anyone with complex financial affairs to have one as well.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">At Banner Jones we can advise you on the best course of action for your particular circumstances.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">One of our most frequent questions would be:</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">My father is elderly and has said that he would prefer me to deal with his bills and finances for him. Can I do this?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">As long as your father has mental capacity he could do this by giving you &ldquo;power of attorney&rdquo; which will allow you to look after things for up to a year for him. If he later loses mental capacity, however, then the power of attorney will come to an end.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Alternatively, your father could give you Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA). This would not come to an end if your father were to lose mental capacity later on, and will last indefinitely, not just for one year. We would need to see your father personally so we can explain the LPA to him and make sure this is what he wants. We would then be able to prepare a document for him to sign, which would give you power to deal with his finances on his behalf.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">We will tailor-make the LPA to suit your father&rsquo;s wishes and we can discuss his options with him at the initial appointment. It cannot be used until it is registered with the Office of the Public Guardian, and we would be happy to deal with this too.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Why not read our&nbsp;<a href="../../../assets/stored_documents/original/13_Factsheet - Lasting Power of Attorney.docx?1322579386" target="_blank">FREE GUIDE</a>&nbsp;to LPAs?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">What do I do next?</span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">We are always keen to find the best solution possible for your particular circumstances, and we know that no two families are the same.

This can be quite a demanding role and you should know what&rsquo;s involved before agreeing to become a trustee.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Trustees have various duties and powers which are given to them either by the general law, the Trust deed (or Will) or a combination of both. It is essential that a Trustee understands the duties imposed on him and the powers available.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">If there is more than one Trustee they must act unanimously. Loosely:-</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">"<strong>Duties</strong>" are&nbsp;<strong>obligations</strong>&nbsp;imposed on Trustees instructing them to do certain things. "<strong>Powers</strong>" are&nbsp;<strong>permissions</strong>, allowing the Trustees to do certain things.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">It is essential to consult the Trust Deed (or Will) itself to see what the powers and duties of a particular trust will be.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Trustees manage Trust Funds on behalf of the&nbsp;<strong>Settlor</strong>&nbsp;(the person who sets up the Trust), for the benefit of the&nbsp;<strong>Beneficiaries</strong>. The Trustees must make sure that their actions are in the best interests of&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;the Beneficiaries. The Beneficiaries have the power to make sure the Trustees are doing so and they may take legal action against the Trustees if they act outside the terms of the Trust.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">All Trustees must be over 18 and mentally capable. They should ideally also have a sound financial history. It is possible for a Beneficiary to also be a Trustee but this can give rise to a conflict of interest. There is no limit to the number of Trustees a particular Trust can have (with the exception of land, where there cannot be more than 4 trustees), but it is strongly advised that there be at least 2. It is possible for a Trustee to retire but the other Trustee(s) must agree to this. It is not possible for you to retire if you are the only Trustee unless someone else is appointed to act in your place. Trustees should also remember that even after retiring they can still be held responsible for their actions before retirement.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">There are some circumstances in which a Trustee can be removed against their Will, for example if they are made bankrupt or remain outside the UK for more than 12 months or refuse to carry out their duties.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Duty to act impartially</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">The Trustees must invest the Trust Fund and generally administer the Trust in accordance with the Trust deed (or Will) and may take into account any letter of wishes. They must act fairly and impartially towards all the beneficiaries and must not benefit one beneficiary at the expense of another. They should treat all beneficiaries of the same class equally and of different classes fairly.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Duty to secure trust property</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">For example, this might mean that the Trustees would have to recover a debt owed to the Trust.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Duty to keep records</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Trustees must keep records of what they do as they need these to prove that Trust has been properly managed. This includes keeping accounts, minutes of meetings and all other Trust documents. They must also allow inspection of these records by the Beneficiaries.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Duty not to benefit themselves</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">The Trustees must not make a profit out of the Trust for themselves &ndash; they must act as volunteers (although there is a power for professional Trustees to charge, as set out below). They must not profit either directly or indirectly, although this rule can be expressly excluded in the Trust deed (or Will).</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Duty to enquire of Trust property</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">In other words, the Trustees must find out what assets are in the Trust, take control of them and ensure their preservation.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Duty to act with reasonable care and skill</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Whenever the Trustees carry out certain functions (such as the power to invest, as set out below) there is a statutory duty on them to act with reasonable care and skill. The duty takes into account whether the Trustee is a professional and the level of knowledge and experience which he has or ought reasonably to have. Consequently, higher standards will be expected of investment professionals than of lay people.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Duty to keep investments under review</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">All the duties imposed on the Trustees require them to carefully consider the circumstances of the Trust, its Beneficiaries and investments on a regular basis. It is very important that every Trustee is actively involved in the administration of the Trust and in particular in the investment decisions. It is not sufficient for a Trustee to simply leave the decisions to his co-Trustees or for all the Trustees to simply leave the Trust investments in one place from year to year. They will need to hold a formal review and record the reasons for their decisions, at least once every year.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">A Trustee&rsquo;s powers will usually be contained in the Trust deed (or Will) itself and can be very wide-ranging. There are also powers given by the general law (unless they are excluded or amended by the Trust deed (or Will)):-</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Power of Investment</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Trustees have the same powers as an individual would have in relation to assets. To balance this power, the Trustees must have regard to:-</p>\r\n<ol style="text-align: left;">\r\n<li>The need for diversification&nbsp; and the suitability of the Trust&rsquo;s investments;</li>\r\n<li>The duty to keep investments under review; and</li>\r\n<li>The need to obtain and consider &ldquo;proper advice&rdquo; when making a reviewing investments.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Power to delegate</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">The law allows Trustees to delegate to an agent (such as an accountant or solicitor) any of their functions including the powers of investment. There are, however, 4 areas which cannot be delegated:-</p>\r\n<ol style="text-align: left;">\r\n<li>Dispositive powers (i.e. those relating to the distribution of Trust property);</li>\r\n<li>Power to decide whether payments should be made out of income or capital;</li>\r\n<li>Power of appointing new Trustees;</li>\r\n<li>Power of delegation itself.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Where Trustees delegate to an agent providing asset management services, the law requires a written statement called a&nbsp;<strong>Policy Statement</strong>, providing guidance to the agent as to how the Trust assets are to be managed. The agent&rsquo;s performance against this Policy Statement must be reviewed regularly.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Power to insure</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Trustees may insure in full of the Trust property as if the property were their own. Insurance premiums can be paid out of income or capital of the Trust fund. It will not always be appropriate to insure Trust property, for example where the cost outweighs the benefit, but if the Trustees decide not to insure then they should set out their reasons for this decision, preferably in writing. They would then not be liable for any loss incurred.</p>\r\n<p><strong>For more information on Trusts, or to arrange an appointment with our expert solicitors, call <span class="calltracks_bannerjonescouk-main">0330 017 6309</span></strong>*<strong>&nbsp;or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@bannerjones.co.uk">info@bannerjones.co.uk</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p>*<strong><sub>calls cost no more than a local 01 number and are included in your mobile minutes.</sub></strong></p>', '2011-03-03 12:16:10', '2015-03-19 11:47:42', '', '', 1, 2, 0, NULL, 1, 0, '<p>We can involve Independent Financial Advisors in our discussions at no extra cost to you</p>', '108_iStock_000013859617XSmall.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 98164, '2011-04-14 15:45:41', '', 'family_highlight', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', 'Trusts.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 57223, '2011-03-03 12:18:38', 'Trusts', '', '', 'Trusts', '', '', 9, 'family_highlight', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', 0, '', '', ''),

For example:</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Owning as "Joint Tenants"</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">This way, neither of you owns an identifiable share of the property. You collectively own the whole thing - essentially you hold it on trust for yourselves. This means that when one of you dies, the property automatically passes to the survivor(s). It does not matter whether or not the deceased co-owner had a Will.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Owning as "Tenants in Common"</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">By owning this way, you each own an identifiable share of the property. Unless you have stated otherwise, this will be 50% each for 2 owners or one third each for 3 owners etc. You are each free to use your share in any way you want. You can give it away during your lifetime, or can leave it to someone under your Will. Owning as Tenants in Common, the property will not automatically pass to the surviving owner(s) so it is&nbsp;<em>vital</em>&nbsp;that you each have a Will.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Why is it important to own the right way?</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">You MUST own the property as Tenants in Common if you want to:-</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: left;">\r\n<li>Give your share to someone else</li>\r\n<li>Leave your share under your Will</li>\r\n<li>Put your share into trust for someone else&rsquo;s benefit</li>\r\n<li>Engage in any inheritance tax planning</li>\r\n<li>Plan for future care fees</li>\r\n<li>Have extra flexibility in dealing with your assets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">If you don&rsquo;t know how your current property is&nbsp;owned, &nbsp;the chances are you own as joint tenants. However, we can easily check this for you. All we need is to see your title deeds.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">It is very simple to change from joint tenants to tenants in common. We would be happy to prepare the necessary paperwork and register the change at HM Land Registry on your behalf.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">If you are Tenants in Common already and want to change the share of the property that you each own, this can be done easily and we can provide an estimate of cost for you.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Equity Release Schemes</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">There are various schemes which allow you to release some of the value (&ldquo;equity&rdquo;) that is locked into your home. They allow you to obtain either a lump sum or a regular income or both without having to move home. There are a variety of different schemes available and you will need expert legal and financial advice if you are considering this as an option.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Equity Release schemes have earned a poor reputation in former years, but the regime is now much more regulated than it was. We would still strongly advise you to seek proper legal and financial advice before considering it.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">To be eligible for any of the schemes available, you must generally speaking:-</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: left;">\r\n<li>Be aged at least 60</li>\r\n<li>Own your own home</li>\r\n<li>Have paid off all or almost all of any existing mortgage over the property</li>\r\n<li>Own a property worth at least &pound;40,000</li>\r\n<li>Own a property built out of brick or stone</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">What different schemes are available?<br />The schemes fall under 2 broad headings: &ldquo;Reversion Schemes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lifetime Mortgage Schemes&rdquo;. Each type will have advantages and disadvantages.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Reversion Schemes</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">These schemes involve you selling all or part of your home to a Reversion Company. In return, you receive a lump sum or a monthly income. You and your partner can stay in the home, usually rent free, for the rest of your lives. When the property is eventually sold (usually on the 2nd death), the Reversion Company receives a % of the sale proceeds equal to the % of the property that they bought from you.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Lifetime Mortgage Schemes</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">This heading covers a variety of different mortgage schemes, all of which involve you borrowing money secured on the value of your home. Again, you can receive either a lump sum or a monthly income. You continue to own all of your home and the loan is repaid to the lender when your home is sold. You can choose whether to make interest payments or whether the interest is &ldquo;rolled up&rdquo; and paid back when the property is sold.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">What will it cost?</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">There are all sorts of &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; costs including:</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: left;">\r\n<li>Completion, arrangement or application fees</li>\r\n<li>Valuation fees</li>\r\n<li>Insurance</li>\r\n<li>Early repayment charges</li>\r\n<li>Legal fees</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Other considerations</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">You should also consider the following:</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: left;">\r\n<li>If your circumstances change in future, will you be able to move home?</li>\r\n<li>Any equity release scheme will affect the inheritance you are able to leave to your children or grandchildren</li>\r\n<li>There could be implications for your entitlement to social security benefits</li>\r\n<li>Who will be responsible for repairs and maintenance of the property?</li>\r\n<li>Tax implications</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Is Equity Release right for me?</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">It may be that you could consider other options instead, such as moving to a smaller property or cashing in other &ldquo;nest eggs&rdquo;, such as premium bonds or savings.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">How can I find out more?</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">If you are considering releasing some of the equity in your home, please book an appointment and we will be happy to discuss your options. We can meet you with your financial adviser if you wish, to make sure the advice is integrated. If you do not already have a financial adviser, we would be happy to recommend a specialist, independent adviser who can discuss your circumstances in detail.</p>\r\n<p><strong>For more information, or to arrange an appointment, call <span class="calltracks_bannerjonescouk-main">0330 017 6309</span></strong>*<strong>&nbsp;or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@bannerjones.co.uk">info@bannerjones.co.uk</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p>*<strong><sub>calls cost no more than a local 01 number and are included in your mobile minutes.</sub></strong></p>', '2011-03-03 12:19:44', '2015-03-19 11:48:07', '', '', 1, 2, 0, NULL, 1, 0, '<p>Worried about how you''ll pay for&nbsp;Care Home fees?

They allow for property and assets to be held by trustees for the benefit of one or more individuals - these can be adult or children.

We would still strongly advise you to seek proper legal and financial advice before considering it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Why not <a href="../../../articles/36" target="_blank">read our article </a>and find out whether it is really right for you?</p>\r\n<p>To be eligible for any of the schemes available, you must generally speaking:-</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Be aged at least 60 Own your own home Have paid off all or almost all of any existing mortgage over the property </li>\r\n<li>Own a property worth at least &pound;40,000 </li>\r\n<li>Own a property built out of brick or stone</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;What different schemes are available?</h2>\r\n<p>The schemes fall under 2 broad headings: &ldquo;Reversion Schemes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lifetime Mortgage Schemes&rdquo;. Each type will have advantages and disadvantages.</p>\r\n<h2>Reversion Schemes</h2>\r\n<p>These schemes involve you selling all or part of your home to a Reversion Company. In return, you receive a lump sum or a monthly income. You and your partner can stay in the home, usually rent free, for the rest of your lives. When the property is eventually sold (usually on the 2nd death), the Reversion Company receives a % of the sale proceeds equal to the % of the property that they bought from you.</p>\r\n<h2>Lifetime Mortgage Schemes</h2>\r\n<p>This heading covers a variety of different mortgage schemes, all of which involve you borrowing money secured on the value of your home. Again, you can receive either a lump sum or a monthly income. You continue to own all of your home and the loan is repaid to the lender when your home is sold. You can choose whether to make interest payments or whether the interest is &ldquo;rolled up&rdquo; and paid back when the property is sold.</p>\r\n<h2>What will it cost?</h2>\r\n<p>There are all sorts of &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; costs including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Completion</li>\r\n<li>arrangement or application fees</li>\r\n<li>Valuation fees</li>\r\n<li>Insurance</li>\r\n<li>Early repayment charges</li>\r\n<li>Legal fees</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You should also consider the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If your circumstances change in future, will you be able to move home? Any equity release scheme will affect the inheritance you are able to leave to your children or grandchildren</li>\r\n<li>There could be implications for your entitlement to social security benefits</li>\r\n<li>Who will be responsible for repairs and maintenance of the property? </li>\r\n<li>Tax implications </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Is Equity Release right for me?</h2>\r\n<p>It may be that you could consider other options instead, such as moving to a smaller property or cashing in other &ldquo;nest eggs&rdquo;, such as premium bonds or savings.</p>\r\n<h2>How can I find out more?</h2>\r\n<p>If you are considering releasing some of the equity in your home, please book an appointment and we will be happy to discuss your options.

The adultery does not need to be the cause of the breakdown of the marriage. You do, however, need to be able to prove that your spouse has&nbsp;had sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex and it is not sufficient simply to suspect that adultery has taken place. It is best to ensure in advance that your spouse will agree that they have committed adultery.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You cannot petition for a divorce on the basis of your own adultery. In these circumstances either your spouse needs to petition for divorce on the basis of adultery or you need to be able to state a different reason for divorce.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Adultery cannot be used in cases of sexual intercourse with a member of the same sex.</p>\r\n<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. </strong><strong>Unreasonable Behaviour</strong></h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Unreasonable behaviour is now the most common reason cited for divorce in England and Wales, in part because of its flexibility and ability to be used under varied <a href="http://www.solicitorssheffield.net/contact-us.html"></a>circumstances. This might include violence, threats, abuse, mental cruelty, financial irresponsibility or even just prolonged failure to give emotional and practical support within the marriage. You can obtain a divorce if your spouse has behaved so unreasonably that you cannot be expected to continue living with him/her.&nbsp; You should be aware however that it is more than the fact that you simply do not get on any longer and that you have drifted apart and there needs to be some particular behaviour by your spouse that you can point to as being unreasonable.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Same sex couples can cite unreasonable behaviour if their partner has been unfaithful as a reason to dissolve their civil partnership.</p>\r\n<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. &nbsp;Separation for two years and the other party consents to the divorce</strong></h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If your spouse refuses to agree, then you cannot obtain a divorce on this basis.You must be clear that the marriage was at an end before the two year period starts to run.</p>\r\n<h3 style="text-align: justify;">4. <strong>Separation for five years when consent is not required </strong></h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You will be entitled to obtain a divorce without consent after you have lived apart for a period of five years.</p>\r\n<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5.&nbsp; Desertion by the other party for two years&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You can obtain a divorce if your spouse has deserted you and you have lived apart for a period of at least two years before starting the divorce.This is when your spouse has left you, against your will, for more than two years. The petitioning spouse must be able to demonstrate to the courts satisfaction that they always wanted their partner to return during this time, otherwise it is not desertion. &nbsp;Due&nbsp;to the other grounds for divorce that exist, it is very rare to come across a petition on this basis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If you would like to speak to one of our experts who can help you decide which grounds for divorce are most appropriate for your personal circumstance then contact us now.</p>', '2011-08-11 11:14:12', '2014-02-12 14:20:13', '', '', 2, 1, 0, NULL, 1, 0, '<p>Fixed Fee Divorce</p>\r\n<p>A fresh approach ...</p>', '65_iStock_000002761784XSmall.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 140936, '2011-08-11 11:34:28', '', 'family_highlight', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', '', NULL, '/page/fixed-fee-divorce', '', 5, 'family_highlight', 'Here to help you ..locally', '/web/contact_us', '', '181_New family march 13.JPG', 'image/jpeg', 227542, '2013-03-28 10:33:54', '', 0, NULL, NULL, NULL),

This will help to minimise legal fees and avoid the necessity of going to Court to reach a settlement.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If an agreement can be reached out of Court then your solicitor will draw up a consent order giving full details of the agreement reached. Both parties sign this agreement <a href="http://www.solicitorssheffield.net/contact-us.html"></a>and it is then sent to the Court for a Judge to check it is reasonable before the Court endorses it as a legally binding order. We would always advise couples to try and come to an sgreement before having to go through the Court process.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What if we can&rsquo;t agree?</strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We would always advise couples to try and come to an agreement so to avoid having to go through the Court process but we know sometimes it is just not possible to agree.&nbsp;&nbsp;In these cases an application will be made to the Court and a timetable will be fixed. It is essentially a three stage process:</p>\r\n<ol style="text-align: justify;" type="1">\r\n<li><strong>First directions appointment "FDA":</strong><br />During the first stage both parties have to disclose their financial circumstances to the Judge. Our experts will deal with all the paperwork and ensure that everything is in order prior to the hearing. At this stage the Judge is checking that we have all the information we need and will give directions to progress the case to stage 2, for example, whether any valuations of property or businesses are required.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Financial dispute resolution hearing "FDR":</strong><br />Here the Judge will give guidance to the parties on areas of dispute and will encourage the parties to find a compromise solution which is fair to both of them. Most cases do settle at this stage.</li>\r\n<li><strong>The trial: </strong><br />If the case cannot settle, then a trial date will be fixed and the Judge will hear evidence from both parties and solicitors before deciding what should happen and making an order which the Judge considers to be fair.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Clean Break Agreements</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A clean break is a type of settlement where all finances are finalised at the point an agreement is implemented. It usually involves a split of assets between the parties with no ongoing spousal maintenance.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A clean break is also achievable in cases where spousal maintenance would normally be payable. If enough assets exist to enable the party liable to pay maintenance to transfer assets of a suitable amount, then this can negate the payment of maintenance on a capitalised basis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Once a clean break has been accepted by the court then neither party can try to claim additional assets or maintenance at a later date, no matter what their change of circumstances.<br /><br />A clean break applies only to your spouse. It is not possible to get a financial clean break in respect of your children as you have an ongoing financial responsibility to support them.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All financial settlements are different as they are based on the circumstances of the individuals involved but our experts are here to guide you through the process and make sure you get your fair share of the matrimonial assets.</p>', '2011-08-11 13:24:22', '2014-02-12 14:20:16', '', '', 2, 1, 0, NULL, 1, 0, '<p>If you have a Will in place with your spouse and you are getting divorced, do not forget to change your Will</p>\r\n<p>We can help you</p>', '102_iStock_000012393462XSmall.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 57204, '2011-08-11 13:44:17', '', 'family_highlight', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', '', NULL, '/page/making-a-will', '', NULL, 'family_highlight', '', '/page/making-a-will', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', 0, NULL, NULL, NULL),

We now do this on a fixed fee basis making it easier for you to budget for this element.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Finances and property</strong>: agreeing things such as who will have the family home, how other assets are distributed and whether maintenance will be payable.</li>\r\n<li><strong><a href="../../../page/children" target="_blank"><strong>Children</strong>:</a></strong> agreeing who your children will live with, contact rights for the other partner and financial maintenance. We have specialist in this area who can help you come to the best solution.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">An important aspect of the cost of any divorce is how much the parties involved are able to reach agreement. If you and your spouse have substantial disagreements <a href="http://www.solicitorssheffield.net/contact-us.html"></a>about arrangements for children and finances, and these have to be negotiated through both parties divorce solicitors, then the cost can increase significantly.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">At&nbsp;Banner Jones we will negotiate firmly on your behalf but will always attempt to keep your costs to a reasonable level in the process.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Who pays the fees for divorce?</strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In most cases you will both need to employ separate solicitors to advise you and act for you in negotiations and possibly at Court, so you will both incur costs.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The person initiating the divorce petition (the &lsquo;petitioner&rsquo;)<a href="http://www.solicitorssheffield.net/legal-aid-divorce-family.html"></a> will incur additional Court fees on top of the fees for their solicitor preparing the case. The person being petitioned against (the &lsquo;respondent&rsquo;) will incur the costs of their solicitor preparing a reply to the petition.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The petitioner may claim some or all of his/her divorce costs from the respondent. Costs orders are typically made on petitions citing adultery or unreasonable behaviour.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In cases where an amicable agreement can be reached it is often possible for the costs of the divorce to be shared equally between the parties&nbsp;and for no orders to be made. This is distinct from the costs of resolving the financial/property issues and any issues concerning the children where the general rule is that each party is responsible for payment of their own legal fees.</p>', '2011-08-11 13:49:07', '2014-02-12 14:20:19', '', '', 2, 1, 0, NULL, 1, 0, '<p>Getting Divorced?</p>\r\n<p>Need to sell the matrimonial home?</p>\r\n<p>We can help</p>', '62_iStock_000002026541XSmall.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 253141, '2011-08-11 14:05:28', '', 'family_highlight', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', '', NULL, '/page/selling', '', 5, 'family_highlight', 'Here to help you ...locally', '/web/contact_us', '', '181_New family march 13.JPG', 'image/jpeg', 227542, '2013-03-28 10:37:28', '', 0, NULL, NULL, NULL),

We can also build scenarios, test the ''what if'' scenarios invariably rise, such as death of a partner, or enforced retirement due to illness or disability.<br /><br />How powerful would it be for you to know when you could afford to retire, or calculate the sums you need to realise from the sale of the business in order to achieve and/or maintain the desired lifestyle in retirement?</span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>Pension Planning</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When a marriage or civil partnership breaks down, a pension fund is often one of the major components of the financial settlement. It is important that the treatment of the pension fund is given careful thought and consideration. Our access to impartial advice will help provide a comprehensive overview, including a transfer value analysis if necessary, culminating in a report on the options available, including offset, earmarking and pension sharing orders.<br /><br />Where a pension sharing order is awarded we provide access to all the necessary impartial advice, assessing a suitable future investment strategy and administrative support to complete the transaction to a personal pension arrangement.<br /><br /><strong>Financial Protection</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The death, serious illness or loss of employment of a divorced spouse and/or parent can have disastrous financial consequences for dependents who have been awarded earmarking orders. Serious consideration should be given to protecting term maintenance payments, or at the very least these issues discussed and offered to every client at risk.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Business Protection</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Why do business owners insure the desk they sit behind, but not the Key Person, the income generator sat behind it? It is fact that the vast majority of businesses in the UK do not have adequate protection for their most valuable assets, that is, their Key Personnel. We have access to considerable experience in advising business owners on Key Man Protection and Partnership/Shareholder Protection. Where necessary we can assist with draft wordings of Cross/Double Option Agreements and business trust documentation to mitigate the effects of CGT and IHT.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lifetime Cash Flow Forecasting</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We offer our clients access to a comprehensive financial plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes a valuable lifetime cash flow forecast, which is an indication as to whether your financial strategy will enable&nbsp;you to achieve your personal lifestyle goals and leave you secure for life, or whether&nbsp;you are likely to run out of capital at some point. We can also test the most common ''what if'' scenarios such as death of a partner, or enforced retirement due to illness or disability.<br /><br />How powerful would it be to be able to advise business owners when deciding if and when they could afford to retire, or calculate the sum they needed to realise from the sale of the business in order to achieve and/or maintain the desired lifestyle in retirement?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Banner Jones Wealth Management is:</em></p>\r\n<p><em>-the trading name of Banner Jones Wealth Management LLP (registered in England &amp; Wales, number OC380075)</em></p>\r\n<p><em>-a separate&nbsp;legal entity&nbsp;to Banner&nbsp;Jones ltd</em></p>\r\n<p><em>-is not a law firm&nbsp;authorised or regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority</em></p>\r\n<p><em>-an&nbsp;&nbsp;Appointed Representative of Future Life Wealth Management Ltd which is authorised and regulated by the Financial&nbsp;Conduct &nbsp;Authority.</em></p>', '2013-02-14 09:16:16', '2014-07-08 14:16:20', '', '', 2, 2, 0, NULL, 1, 0, '<p>Your Wealth...</p>\r\n<p>In Good Hands</p>', '178_BJ_WEALTH_MANAGEMENT_WHITE.JPG', 'image/jpeg', 45123, '2013-03-19 09:26:43', '', 'family_highlight', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, 'family_highlight', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', 1, '', '', ''),

(190, 'Types of Wills', 'types_of_wills', 'Types of Wills | Probate Solicitors in Sheffield | Banner Jones', 183, 0, 0, 1, '2010-04-29 08:55:42', '<p style="text-align: left;">One size does not fit all when it comes to a Will.&nbsp; There are several types available and we are here to help you decide on which one best suits your needs.&nbsp; No two Wills we write are ever the same but here are&nbsp;some typical examples of the Wills we write.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Standard Mirror Wills</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Typically for a husband and wife with a modest estate who want to leave everything to each other and then on to their children.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">A typical scenario would be a husband leaving his whole estate to his wife. If she dies before her husband then his whole estate is divided equally between their adult children. The wife makes a Mirror Will which reflects her husband&rsquo;s<br />Will. This type of Will is suitable for clients who have modest assets and where the adult children are their natural children i.e. there are no step children involved. Clients sometimes are not aware however that if the husband leaves everything to the wife and dies first, then she is free to make a new Will in<br />the future. She may remarry and leave everything to her new husband rather than her children.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Property Trust Will (Life Interest Will)</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">This type of Will (also known as a Life Interest Trust Will) is suitable for those clients who want to ensure that their share of their main asset i.e. the family home, is inherited by their children.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">The Will ensures that the surviving spouse (who may already own a share of the family home) has the right to live in the property for the rest of his/her life but will not inherit the ownership of the deceased&rsquo;s share of the property. This type of Will is often used where there are step-children involved so that the needs of all family members can be taken into account. Clients who are concerned about the family home being used to pay for the surviving spouse&rsquo;s care home fees can also benefit from this type of Will.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Wills for Young Children</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Where the main beneficiaries of the Will are young children then extra provisions are recommended. Careful thought should be given to who will be the Trustees that will look after the assets until the children are old enough to inherit. Parents can appoint Guardians who will be responsible for the day to day care of the children.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">The Guardians and Trustees do not have to be the same people. The age of the Trustees can be a factor &ndash; appointing grandparents who may have to manage the money for over 20 years may not be the answer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Very often professional Trustees such as solicitors are the most appropriate Trustees who will invest the money with the benefit of professional expert advice rather than leaving inexperienced Trustees who very often leave the money to sit in a low-interest bearing bank account.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Specialist Wills</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">There are many types of specialist Wills. A Discretionary trust Will remains a popular choice. This Will places the estate into a flexible type of trust known as a Discretionary Trust. With the right Trustees in place it allows the deceased&rsquo;s estate to be distributed as the family decide in the future. It allows the family to &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo;. Clients who are worried about beneficiaries with financial problems or possible divorces see the benefit of these types of Wills.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">There are also special types of Wills for disabled persons as well as what are often described as Bloodline Wills to ensure that the assets are passed along the bloodline of the family rather than being passed to the spouses or partners of your children or grandchildren.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Finally Spousal Bypass Trusts and Wills are an increasingly common combination of Trust and Will designed to minimise the Inheritance Tax which can arise as a result of pension benefits passing directly to the spouse.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">If you are unsure as to which type of Will would be best for you and your family then please give us a call and we will be happy to discuss this with you.&nbsp; All of our Wills are tailor made to suit your needs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>For more information, or to arrange an appointment with an expert, call <span class="calltracks_bannerjonescouk-main">0330 017 6309</span></strong>*<strong>&nbsp;or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@bannerjones.co.uk">info@bannerjones.co.uk</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p>*<strong><sub>calls cost no more than a local 01 number and are included in your mobile minutes.</sub></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>', '2013-04-24 10:22:56', '2015-07-22 11:17:14', '', '', 2, 1, 0, NULL, 1, 0, 'All of our Wills come with FREE registration on to the Certainty national Wills register', '170_CertaintyNewLogo.JPG', 'image/jpeg', 44954, '2013-04-24 11:00:22', '', 'family_highlight', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', '', '', '', '', '', 9, 'family_highlight', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', 0, '<p><a href="../../../assets/stored_documents/original/61_Family - Wills 2011 - Updated 07.04.14.pdf?1396883400" target="_blank">Download Banner Jones Wills Leaflet</a></p>\r\n<p><img src="../../../assets/stored_images/original/260_Family - Wills 2011.png?1396885003" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="250" /></p>', '', ''),

We know that saving for an adequate deposit can be&nbsp;very hard for&nbsp;buyers&nbsp;in the current market&nbsp;so the loan will help&nbsp;to bridge the gap between what&nbsp;you can borrow from a mortgage lender and what&nbsp;you can afford as a deposit.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>Key Facts</strong></p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n<li><span style="font-size: small;">The loans are available on new build properties only</span></li>\r\n<li><span style="font-size: small;">It is open to both&nbsp;first time buyers and people who have a&nbsp; property to sell</span></li>\r\n<li><span style="font-size: small;">It must be the person&rsquo;s main residence. It cannot be sublet or be a&nbsp;second home</span></li>\r\n<li><span style="font-size: small;">You cannot keep your existing property and let it out</span></li>\r\n<li><span style="font-size: small;">You must take out the standard first mortgage with a qualifying lender</span></li>\r\n<li><span style="font-size: small;">There is no higher income threshold</span></li>\r\n<li><span style="font-size: small;">The maximum purchase price is &pound;600,000</span></li>\r\n<li><span style="font-size: small;">The loan will be repaid on the sale of the property or after 25 years, whichever comes first. You can also make voluntary repayments</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In an example where&nbsp;you purchase a &pound;200,000 home under the scheme the agency&rsquo;s contribution of the equity loan totals &pound;40,000 or 20% of the purchase price. You will be required to produce a 5% deposit of &pound;10,000 and a mortgage of &pound;150,000.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />The equity loan is interest free for the first 5 years. After 5 years you pay a fee of 1.75% rising annually by the increase in the retail price index plus 1%. In year 6 on the previous example of &pound;40,000 this would be approximately &pound;58 a month.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Phase 2 October 2013:</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Homebuyers can now consider whether to take advantage of the second phase of the Government''s Help to Buy scheme, brought in three months early in a bid to help revive the property market.</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Phase 2&nbsp; is available to existing home-owners looking to move to any type of property, not just first-time buyers.&nbsp;The buyer must still put up at least a 5 per cent cash deposit, but the Government no longer lends actual cash to the buyer. Instead, it guarantees up to 15 per cent of the mortgage granted so that, if the borrower defaults and the property is repossessed and sold for less than the balance of the mortgage, the lender can apply direct to the Government for repayment under the guarantee.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The buyer therefore only needs to contribute a cash deposit of 5 per cent of the purchase price, and satisfy the lender''s usual checks. The aim is to reduce the risk to lenders so that they can offer cheaper interest rates to buyers. The lender pays the Government a fee for its guarantee.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The property must be worth less than &pound;600,000, and borrowers must not own any buy-to-let properties or intend to keep the home they currently live in after the purchase.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;">How to buy a help to buy home</h2>\r\n<h3><strong>Stage 1- Application</strong></h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong><br />An application needs to be made to the local help to buy agent. The application&nbsp;includes a Property Information Form which shows details of the proposed purchase, main mortgage, deposit and household income. The Property Information Form also confirms&nbsp;your agreement to the funds due being paid directly to the house builder.</p>\r\n<p>You will need to sign the Property Information Form with a copy of the Builders Reservation Form which must be sent to the local home buyer agent.</p>\r\n<h3>Authority to proceed</h3>\r\n<p>The local home buyer agent assesses the application and if passed they will issue an authority to proceed. This is valid for 3 months and exchange of contracts must take place within this period.</p>\r\n<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<strong>Stage 2- Exchange of Contracts</strong></h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You will need to go through the normal&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: small;"><a href="../../../assets/stored_documents/original/4_buying a home process one pages.pdf?1300809818" target="_blank">conveyancing process</a>&nbsp;</span>with regard to the property but you will also need legal support with the signing of the help to buy equity loan agreement. &nbsp;Banner Jones&nbsp;can help you with this.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We will need to check that the mortgage offer, property price and available funds are consistent with the authority to proceed and request permission to exchange contracts from the local home buyer agents.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">An approval is received before contracts can be exchanged.</p>\r\n<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stage 3- Completion</strong></h3>\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n<li>The agents pay the funds direct to the developer.</li>\r\n<li>We return confirmation of the sale to the local home buyer agent who will then register the details with the post sale home buyer agent. </li>\r\n<li>We deal with the registration of the second charge. ie, the loan</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sale of the property</span></strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Consent from the post sale home buyer agent is required and the agencies mortgage will only be released with their permission.

This is often called "totting up" or being a "totter upper". This is relatively easy to do, and can be the result of a few minor speeding offences over a three year period. This is often the only time that a person appears in court and can be stressful due to the day in court itself, and because of the driving disqualification. It has also been suggested that if you do receive a totting up driving ban your insurance premiums could increase drastically.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">The rules that normally apply say that a driver who accumulates 12 or more penalty points within 3 years will receive a 6 month driving ban as a totter upper. Some courts do exercise discretion and there have been examples of 3 month bans being imposed, however, we would advise you to talk to a qualified driving defence solicitor in Sheffield and Chesterfield who can advise you if it would be possible to convince the court that you should be allowed to keep your licence.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">Totting Up Driving Ban Rules</span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">If you accumulate 12 points in any 3 years you will face a totting up driving disqualification as your points are valid for 3 years from the date of conviction, but cannot be removed until their fourth anniversary.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Do not be mistaken and assume that you can delay a case to circumvent the totting up rules. If you currently had 9 points on your licence, with 3 points due to expire, delaying the court hearing until after those 3 points have been dropped will NOT mean you will escape disqualification as a totter upper. The court looks at the number of points that were currently on your licence at the time your recent offence was committed.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">The courts, however, do not have to disqualify you. As mentioned, they may allow you to keep your licence if they can be persuaded that in the circumstances it would cause exceptional hardship. Each person and set of circumstances is different, and the court needs to be persuaded to give you another chance. Our specialist solicitors can advise you on this process from your first point of contact, through to appearing at court on your behalf.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Contact our Specialist Driving Offence Solicitors to discuss the Totting Up process</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Our expert motoring offence solicitors are highly experienced in the totting up process, and will treat each case uniquely, as we know each of our clients have different circumstances.

To be convicted of the offence, the prosecution must prove to the court that you were driving below the standard expected of a competent and careful driver. It is an easy offence to commit by accident by, for example, having a momentary lapse in concentration. If your driving is held below this legal standard, it could affect your livelihood through fines, points on your license or even disqualification from driving.</p>\r\n<p>Dangerous Driving mirrors the definition above, but it must also be obvious to a competent and careful driver that the action would be dangerous. Examples include racing, inappropriate overtaking and even driving with a known medical condition which impairs driving skills. If convicted, the result could be a prison sentence and disqualification.</p>\r\n<h2>Failure to comply with traffic signals</h2>\r\n<p>This offence can often committed through an honest mistake, or a lack of concentration; however, any driver convicted of contravening a traffic signal (e.g. red lights/one way roads) will automatically be given 3 penalty points on their licence.</p>\r\n<p>In many circumstances, these cases can be very defendable based upon disproving unreliable evidence against you from fixed cameras or from a police or civilian witness that reports the behaviour.</p>\r\n<p>The penalties may not be as severe as those associated with other offences, however the impact on your license could damage insurance claims or even lead to disqualification if coupled with other offences. Therefore, expert legal advice from a respected, local firm of specialist solicitors is imperative to gain a successful defence.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<h2>Failure to provide information/stop after an accident</h2>\r\n<p>These offences are actually separate, but are often charged together, and can incur harsh penalties such as points or even disqualification.</p>\r\n<p>You are guilty of failing to stop if you have an accident and do not stop and provide information. This is where complications can occur as you do not have to be directly involved in the accident.</p>\r\n<p>Often, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whose fault the accident is. You still need to stop and exchange information with those involved, or risk a penalty.</p>\r\n<p>The only exception is if you didn&rsquo;t know there was an accident, which is where Banner Jones can significantly aid your chances of a successful defence. Due to the severe sentencing powers available to the Court for these offences, expert advice and representation should be sought from the outset.</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">Find out more information on Careless Driving Offences</span></p>\r\n<p>Our specialist solicitors in Sheffield and Chesterfield will discuss your case with you and provide an expert opinion on whether you have committed an offence or not.&nbsp; Although some offences are easy to commit, the consequences can be great.&nbsp; If the careless driving is of a particularly poor standard, you could be disqualified immediately.

If you have been charged with driving without insurance, contact our specialist Motoring Law Team for advice tailored to your personal circumstances.</p>\r\n<p>Many drivers get caught out with the belief that their fully comprehensive insurance covers them to drive another vehicle owned by someone else, with their permission. Many fully comprehensive policies don&rsquo;t provide this type of cover automatically and this is a common fall for many clients.</p>\r\n<p>To be prosecuted for this offence, the police normally are able to show that a person was driving the vehicle. However, the offence itself is &ldquo;using&rdquo; the vehicle and this has a broader definition than merely driving.</p>\r\n<p>At Banner Jones, our specialist team understand the defence for driving without insurance can be a complex procedure and the sooner you gain expert advice the better. If you need fast, reliable and expert advice please don''t hesitate to contact us.</p>\r\n<h2>Driving Whilst Disqualified</h2>\r\n<p>If caught driving whilst disqualified, the offence can only be tried in the Magistrates'' Court and can carry serious penalties including prison time. &nbsp;At Banner Jones'', our specialist Motoring Law Team have numerous years of experience in handling disqualified driver claims.</p>\r\n<p>Driving whilst disqualified is a strict liability offence meaning that the prosecution only has to prove that you were in control of a motor vehicle whilst being disqualified.

However, we will carefully assess the evidence against you and find your available defence.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Contact a Specialist Driving Offence Solicitor</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Our expert driving offence solicitors in Sheffield and Chesterfield are highly experienced and will treat each case uniquely as we know each of our clients have different circumstances.

We know that saving for an adequate deposit can be very hard for first time buyers in the current market so the loan will help to bridge the gap between what you can borrow from a mortgage lender and what you can afford as a deposit.</p>\r\n<h2>Key facts on the Help to Buy Scheme</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The loans are available on new build properties only</li>\r\n<li>It is open to both first time buyers and people who have a property to sell</li>\r\n<li>It must be the person&rsquo;s main residence. It cannot be a sublet or be a second home</li>\r\n<li>You cannot keep your existing property and let it out</li>\r\n<li>You must take out the standard first mortgage with a qualifying lender </li>\r\n<li>There is no higher income threshold</li>\r\n<li>The maximum purchase price is &pound;600,000</li>\r\n<li>The loan will be repaid on the sale of the property or after 25 years, whichever comes first. You can also make voluntary repayments</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Help to Buy Home Scheme example</h2>\r\n<p>In an example where&nbsp;you purchase a &pound;200,000 home under the <strong>help to buy scheme</strong>, the agency&rsquo;s contribution of the equity loan totals &pound;40,000 or 20% of the purchase price. You will be required to produce a 5% deposit of &pound;10,000 and a mortgage of &pound;150,000.</p>\r\n<p>The equity loan is interest free for the first 5 years. After 5 years you pay a fee of 1.75% rising annually by the increase in the retail price index plus 1%. In year 6 on the previous example of &pound;40,000 this would be approximately &pound;58 a month.</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">The Help to Buy Scheme process explained</span></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Phase 2 October 2013:</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Homebuyers can now consider whether to take advantage of the second phase of the Government''s Help to Buy scheme, brought in three months early in a bid to help revive the property market.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Phase 2&nbsp; is available to existing home-owners looking to move to any type of property, not just first-time buyers.&nbsp;The buyer must still put up at least a 5 per cent cash deposit, but the Government no longer lends actual cash to the buyer. Instead, it guarantees up to 15 per cent of the mortgage granted so that, if the borrower defaults and the property is repossessed and sold for less than the balance of the mortgage, the lender can apply directly to the Government for repayment under the guarantee.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">The buyer needs to contribute a cash deposit of 5 per cent of the purchase price, and to satisfy the lender''s usual checks. The aim is to reduce the risk to lenders so that they can offer cheaper interest rates to buyers. The lender pays the Government a fee for its guarantee.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">The property must be worth less than &pound;600,000, and borrowers must not own any buy-to-let properties or intend to keep the home they currently live in after the purchase.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: justify;">How to buy a help to buy home</h2>\r\n<h3><strong>Stage 1 - Application</strong></h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">An application needs to be made to the local help to buy agent. The application&nbsp;includes a Property Information Form which shows details of the proposed purchase, main mortgage, deposit and household income. The Property Information Form also confirms&nbsp;your agreement to the funds due being paid directly to the house builder.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">You will need to sign the Property Information Form with a copy of the Builders Reservation Form which must be sent to the local home buyer agent.</p>\r\n<h3>Authority to proceed</h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">The local home buyer agent assesses the application and if passed they will issue an authority to proceed. This is valid for 3 months and exchange of contracts must take place within this period.</p>\r\n<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<strong>Stage 2 - Exchange of Contracts</strong></h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">You will need to go through the normal&nbsp;<span style="font-size: small;"><a href="../../../assets/stored_documents/original/4_buying a home process one pages.pdf?1300809818" target="_blank">conveyancing process</a>&nbsp;</span>with regard to the property but you will also need legal support with the signing of the help to buy equity loan agreement. &nbsp;Banner Jones&nbsp;can help you with this.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">We will need to check that the mortgage offer, property price and available funds are consistent with the authority to proceed and request permission to exchange contracts from the local home buyer agents.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">An approval is received before contracts can be exchanged.</p>\r\n<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stage 3 - Completion</strong></h3>\r\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\r\n<li>The agents pay the funds direct to the developer.</li>\r\n<li>We return confirmation of the sale to the local home buyer agent who will then register the details with the post sale home buyer agent. </li>\r\n<li>We deal with the registration of the second charge. ie, the loan</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Sale of the Property</h3>\r\n<p><span style="text-align: justify;">Consent from the post sale home buyer agent is required and the agencies mortgage will only be released with their permission. Their main concern is that the sale of the property is at the correct market value and they can request an independent valuation to ensure this.</span></p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p><strong>For more information, or to arrange an appointment with our expert Conveyancing solicitors, call <span class="calltracks_bannerjonescouk-main">0330 017 6309</span></strong>*<strong>&nbsp;or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@bannerjones.co.uk">info@bannerjones.co.uk</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p>*<strong><sub>calls cost no more than a local 01 number and are included in your mobile minutes.</sub></strong></p>', '2013-06-10 11:31:18', '2015-07-22 11:03:15', 'At Banner Jones we can give you advice on the help to buy scheme and explain simply what the help to buy scheme is and how you could benefit.

They allow you to obtain either a lump sum or a regular income or both without you having to move home. You will need expert legal and financial advice, if you are considering this option.</p>\r\n<p>Equity Release schemes have earned a poor reputation in former years, but the regime is now much more regulated than it was. We would still strongly advise you to seek proper legal and financial advice before considering it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To find out whether equity release is really for you, we have developed the following article outlining key information:</p>\r\n<p><a href="../../../www.bannerjones.co.uk/assets/stored_documents/original/68_Residential Conveyancing - Equity Release - Is Equity Release Right For You.pdf?1400502443" target="_blank"></a><a onclick="pageTracker._trackEvent(''Infographic'', ''Open'', ''Is Equity Release Right for You'');" href="../../../assets/stored_documents/original/68_Residential Conveyancing - Equity Release - Is Equity Release Right For You.pdf?1400502443" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../assets/page_contents/238/contained_images/045e104cd9d4_275_Residential Conveyancing - Equity Release - Is Equity Release Right For You 2.png?1400503093" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" width="250" /></a></p>\r\n<p class="standout_link" style="text-align: center;"><a onclick="pageTracker._trackEvent(''Infographic'', ''Open'', ''Is Equity Release Right for You'');" href="../../../assets/stored_documents/original/68_Residential Conveyancing - Equity Release - Is Equity Release Right For You.pdf?1400502443" target="_blank">Open Article</a></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">How does Equity Release work?</span></p>\r\n<p>To be eligible for any of the equity release schemes available, you must generally speaking:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Be aged at least 60, own your own home, have paid off all or almost all of any existing mortgage over the property.</li>\r\n<li>Own a property worth at least &pound;40,000.</li>\r\n<li>Own a property built out of brick or stone.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>What different Equity Release Schemes are available?</h2>\r\n<p>The schemes fall under 2 broad headings: &ldquo;Reversion Schemes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lifetime Mortgage Schemes&rdquo;. Each type will have advantages and disadvantages.</p>\r\n<h2>Reversion Scheme</h2>\r\n<p>These <strong>equity release</strong> schemes involve you selling all or part of your home to a Reversion Company. In return, you receive a lump sum or a monthly income. You and your partner can stay in the home, usually rent free, for the rest of your lives. When the property is eventually sold (usually on the 2nd death), the Reversion Company receives a % of the sale proceeds equal to the % of the property that they bought from you.</p>\r\n<h2>Lifetime Mortgage Equity Release Schemes</h2>\r\n<p>This heading covers a variety of different <strong>equity release</strong> mortgage schemes, all of which involve you borrowing money secured on the value of your home. Again, you can receive either a lump sum or a monthly income. You continue to own all of your home and the loan is repaid to the lender when your home is sold. You can choose whether to make interest payments or whether the interest is &ldquo;rolled up&rdquo; and paid back when the property is sold.</p>\r\n<h2>Equity Release costs?</h2>\r\n<p><strong>There are all sorts of &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; costs including:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Completion</li>\r\n<li>Arrangement or application fees</li>\r\n<li>Valuation fees</li>\r\n<li>Insurance</li>\r\n<li>Early repayment charges</li>\r\n<li>Legal fees</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>You should also consider the following:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If your circumstances change in the future, will you be able to move home? Any <strong>equity release scheme</strong> will affect the inheritance you are able to leave to your children or grandchildren</li>\r\n<li>There could be implications for your entitlement to social security benefits</li>\r\n<li>Who will be responsible for repairs and maintenance of the property?</li>\r\n<li>Tax implications</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Is Equity Release right for me?</h2>\r\n<p>It may be that you could consider other options as opposed to <strong>equity release</strong>, such as moving to a smaller property or cashing in other &ldquo;nest eggs&rdquo;, such as premium bonds or savings.</p>\r\n<h2>Equity Release advice</h2>\r\n<p>If you are considering releasing some of the equity in your home, please book an appointment and we will be happy to discuss your options. We can meet you with your financial adviser if you wish, to make sure the advice is integrated. If you do not already have a financial adviser, we would be happy to recommend a specialist, independent adviser who can discuss your circumstances in detail.</p>\r\n<p><strong>For more information, or to arrange an appointment with our expert Conveyancing solicitors, call <span class="calltracks_bannerjonescouk-main">0330 017 6309</span></strong>*<strong>&nbsp;or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@bannerjones.co.uk">info@bannerjones.co.uk</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p>*<strong><sub>calls cost no more than a local 01 number and are included in your mobile minutes.</sub></strong></p>', '2011-03-23 15:56:42', '2015-07-22 11:08:52', 'At Banner Jones we offer helpful advice from our expert conveyancing solicitors on equity release and the process.', '', 5, 1, 0, NULL, 1, 0, '<p>Call today for a quote</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', 'family_highlight', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', 'EquityRelease.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 38659, '2011-03-29 11:59:11', 'Equity Release', '', '', 'Equity Release', '/web/contact_us', '', 9, 'family_highlight', '', '/web/contact_us', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', 0, '<p><a href="../../../assets/stored_documents/original/68_Residential Conveyancing - Equity Release - Is Equity Release Right For You.pdf?1400502443" target="_blank">Download Equity Release Document</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="../../../assets/stored_documents/original/68_Residential Conveyancing - Equity Release - Is Equity Release Right For You.pdf?1400502443" target="_blank"><img src="../../../assets/stored_images/original/276_Residential Conveyancing - Equity Release - Is Equity Release Right For You graphic.png?1400503138" border="0" alt="" hspace="0" width="250" /></a></p>', 'Equity Release ', '<div itemscope itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Review-aggregate">\r\n    <span itemprop="itemreviewed">Banner Jones Conveyancing Reviews</span>    \r\n    <span itemprop="rating" itemscope itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Rating">\r\n      <span itemprop="average">4.5</span>\r\n      out of <span itemprop="best">5</span>\r\n    </span>\r\n    based on <span itemprop="votes">6</span> ratings.    \r\n</div>\r\n'),

The adultery does not need to be the cause of the breakdown of the marriage. You do, however, need to be able to prove that your spouse has&nbsp;had sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex and it is not sufficient simply to suspect that adultery has taken place. It is best to ensure in advance that your spouse will agree that they have committed adultery.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You cannot petition for a divorce on the basis of your own adultery. In these circumstances either your spouse needs to petition for divorce on the basis of adultery or you need to be able to state a different reason for divorce.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Adultery cannot be used in cases of sexual intercourse with a member of the same sex.</p>\r\n<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. </strong><strong>Unreasonable Behaviour</strong></h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Unreasonable behaviour is now the most common reason cited for divorce in England and Wales, in part because of its flexibility and ability to be used under varied <a href="http://www.solicitorssheffield.net/contact-us.html"></a>circumstances. This might include violence, threats, abuse, mental cruelty, financial irresponsibility or even just prolonged failure to give emotional and practical support within the marriage. You can obtain a divorce if your spouse has behaved so unreasonably that you cannot be expected to continue living with him/her.&nbsp; You should be aware however that it is more than the fact that you simply do not get on any longer and that you have drifted apart and there needs to be some particular behaviour by your spouse that you can point to as being unreasonable.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Same sex couples can cite unreasonable behaviour if their partner has been unfaithful as a reason to dissolve their civil partnership.</p>\r\n<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. &nbsp;Separation for two years and the other party consents to the divorce</strong></h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If your spouse refuses to agree, then you cannot obtain a divorce on this basis.You must be clear that the marriage was at an end before the two year period starts to run.</p>\r\n<h3 style="text-align: justify;">4. <strong>Separation for five years when consent is not required </strong></h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You will be entitled to obtain a divorce without consent after you have lived apart for a period of five years.</p>\r\n<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5.&nbsp; Desertion by the other party for two years&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You can obtain a divorce if your spouse has deserted you and you have lived apart for a period of at least two years before starting the divorce.This is when your spouse has left you, against your will, for more than two years. The petitioning spouse must be able to demonstrate to the courts satisfaction that they always wanted their partner to return during this time, otherwise it is not desertion. &nbsp;Due&nbsp;to the other grounds for divorce that exist, it is very rare to come across a petition on this basis.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If you would like to speak to one of our experts who can help you decide which grounds for divorce are most appropriate for your personal circumstance then contact us now.</p>', '2011-08-11 11:14:12', '2014-02-12 14:20:13', '', '', 5, 1, 0, NULL, 1, 0, '<p>Fixed Fee Divorce</p>\r\n<p>A fresh approach ...</p>', '65_iStock_000002761784XSmall.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 140936, '2011-08-11 11:34:28', '', 'family_highlight', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', '', NULL, '/page/fixed-fee-divorce', '', 5, 'family_highlight', 'Here to help you ..locally', '/web/contact_us', '', '181_New family march 13.JPG', 'image/jpeg', 227542, '2013-03-28 10:33:54', '', 0, NULL, NULL, NULL),

You can obtain a divorce if your spouse has behaved so unreasonably that you cannot be expected to continue living with him/her.&nbsp; You should be aware however that it is more than the fact that you simply do not get on any longer and that you have drifted apart and there needs to be some particular behaviour by your spouse that you can point to as being unreasonable.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Same sex couples can cite unreasonable behaviour if their partner has been unfaithful as a reason to dissolve their civil partnership.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">3. Separation for two years and the other party consents to a divorce</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">If your spouse refuses to agree, then you cannot obtain a divorce on this basis. You must be clear that the marriage was at an end before the two year period starts to run.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">4. Separation for five years when consent is not required</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">You will be entitled to obtain a divorce without consent after you have lived apart for a period of five years.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">5. Desertion by the other party for two years</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">You can obtain a divorce if your spouse has deserted you and you have lived apart for a period of at least two years before starting the divorce. This is when your spouse has left you, against your will, for more than two years. The petitioning spouse must be able to demonstrate to the courts satisfaction that they always wanted their partner to return during this time, otherwise it is not desertion. &nbsp;Due&nbsp;to the other grounds for divorce that exist, it is very rare to come across a petition on this basis.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Contact one of our Solicitors today for more information on the Grounds for Divorce</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">At Banner Jones we have a team of expert divorce solicitors who are highly experienced and will treat each case uniquely depending on your circumstances.

This will help to minimise legal fees and avoid the necessity of going to Court to reach a divorce settlement.</p>\r\n<p>If an agreement can be reached out of Court then your divorce solicitor will draw up a consent order giving full details of the agreement reached. Both parties sign this agreement&nbsp;and it is then sent to the Court for a Judge to check it is reasonable before the Court endorses it as a legally binding order. We would always advise couples to try and come to an agreement on the divorce settlement before having to go through the Court process.</p>\r\n<h2>What if we can&rsquo;t come to a divorce settlement agreement?</h2>\r\n<p>We would always advise couples to try and come to a financial agreement so to avoid having to go through the Court process but we know sometimes it is just not possible to agree.&nbsp;&nbsp;In these cases an application will be made to the Court and a timetable will be fixed. It is essentially a three stage process:</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. First Directions Appointment</strong></p>\r\n<p>During the first stage both parties have to disclose their financial circumstances to the Judge. Our experts will deal with all the paperwork and ensure that everything is in order prior to the hearing. At this stage the Judge is checking that we have all the information we need and will give directions to progress the case to stage 2, for example, whether any valuations of property or businesses are required.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Financial Dispute Resolution Hearing</strong></p>\r\n<p>Here the Judge will give guidance to the parties on areas of dispute and will encourage the parties to find a compromise solution which is fair to both of them. Most cases do settle at this stage.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. The Trial</strong></p>\r\n<p>If the case cannot settle, then a trial date will be fixed and the Judge will hear evidence from both parties and the divorce solicitors before deciding what should happen and making an order which the Judge considers to be fair.</p>\r\n<h2>Clean Break Agreements</h2>\r\n<p>A clean break is a type of divorce settlement where all finances are finalised at the point an agreement is implemented. It usually involves a split of assets between the parties with no ongoing spousal maintenance.</p>\r\n<p>A clean break is also achievable in cases where spousal maintenance would normally be payable. If enough assets exist to enable the party liable to pay maintenance to transfer assets of a suitable amount, then this can negate the payment of maintenance on a capitalised basis.</p>\r\n<p>Once a clean break has been accepted by the court neither party can try to claim additional assets or maintenance at a later date, no matter what their change of circumstances.</p>\r\n<p>A clean break agreement applies only to your spouse. It is not possible to get a financial clean break in respect of your children as you have an ongoing responsibility to support them.</p>\r\n<h2>Contact a Solicitor for helpful advice on Financial Settlements</h2>\r\n<p>At Banner Jones we have a team of expert divorce solicitors who are highly experienced and will treat each case uniquely depending on your circumstances.

The person being petitioned against (the &lsquo;respondent&rsquo;) will incur the costs of their divorce solicitor preparing a reply to the petition.</p>\r\n<p>The petitioner may claim some or all of his/her divorce costs from the respondent. Costs orders are typically made on petitions citing adultery or unreasonable behaviour.</p>\r\n<p>In cases where an amicable agreement can be reached, it is often possible for the costs of the divorce to be shared equally between the parties and for no orders to be made. This is distinct from the costs of resolving the financial/property issues and any issues concerning the children, where the general rule is that each party is responsible for payment of their own legal fees.</p>\r\n<h2>Contact a Divorce Solicitor for more information on the costs of a divorce:</h2>\r\n<p>Our expert divorce solicitors are highly experienced and will treat each case uniquely depending on your circumstances.

Below are some of the main things which may be taken into consideration.</p>\r\n<ol style="text-align: left;">\r\n<li>The length of the marriage/civil partnership&nbsp;has an impact on the Court''s decision, the longer the marriage the more tendency towards equality.</li>\r\n<li>The relative contributions to wealth created during the marriage/civil partnership.&nbsp; This does not mean that ''stay at home'' spouses will necessarily receive a smaller settlement. If they can demonstrate that they provided the environment and support which enables the ''go getter''&nbsp;to amass wealth, then there is every chance of them being awarded a significant proportion of the assets.&nbsp;&nbsp; If they can prove for example that&nbsp;their own career has been put&nbsp;on hold to look after children this would be part of the consideration.</li>\r\n<li>Wealth brought into the marriage/civil partnership&nbsp;by each party. Usually, the ''non-marital'' assets are divided in the proportion in which each spouse introduced them.&nbsp; Family inheritance is very complex area when it comes to division as the particular context in which the inheritance was given is taken into consideration.</li>\r\n<li>Pension rights. &nbsp;It is important to remember that pension rights form part of the marital assets and these can be divided.</li>\r\n<li>Standard of living.&nbsp; Finances permitting, the standard of living&nbsp;for any children and the parties during the marriage/civil partnership&nbsp;should be preserved at the levels previously enjoyed.</li>\r\n<li>Be aware that the previous behaviour of the parties is not usually a consideration&nbsp;at this stage of the process.</li>\r\n<li>Properly negotiated Pre-Nuptial agreements (if in place), can increasingly influence outcomes.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Banner Jones provide expert advice on Complex Divorce Issues</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">With over&nbsp;150 years of matrimonial experience within our department,&nbsp;we have Solicitors dealing with cases including lottery winners to land owners, business leaders to professional footballers.

Practically, the holders of parental responsibility are entitled to be given information regarding children&rsquo;s education and welfare.</p>\r\n<h2>Parental Responsibility Agreements</h2>\r\n<p>Each parent can generally exercise their parental responsibility independently of the other and, in a day to day situation, there is normally no requirement for parents to consult with the other prior to exercising their parental responsibility.</p>\r\n<p>On certain important decisions it is essential that everyone with Parental Responsibility is consulted. A common example of this would be where one parent takes a child abroad, maybe even just for a holiday. If there is no&nbsp;<em>Child Arrangements Order with a residence element</em>&nbsp;in place, this cannot be done without the consent of the other parent/guardian. If this does happen, we can help make the relevant emergency application through the Court for the return of the child or children.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Unmarried Parents Parental Responsibility Rights</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">The position for unmarried parents is different. Unmarried mothers have parental responsibility for their child. An unmarried father whose name is on the birth certificate and the child was born after 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;December 2003 also has it. &nbsp;An unmarried father for a child born before 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;December 2003 can acquire parental responsibility by either:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Entering into a parental responsibility agreement with the mother</li>\r\n<li>Obtaining a Parental Responsibility&nbsp;order of the Court</li>\r\n<li>Marrying the&nbsp;mother of his child</li>\r\n<li>By ensuring his name is on the birth certificate, either originally&nbsp;or by re-registration of the child&rsquo;s birth to include the father&rsquo;s name</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Contact one of our specialist family solicitors to find out more information on Parental Responsibility</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Our expert solicitors in Sheffield and Chesterfield are highly experienced and will treat each case uniquely depending on your circumstances.

The longer the pre-nuptial agreement is in place prior to a marriage or civil partnership being entered into the better. However, agreements entered into after marriage or Civil Partnership can still have legal effect.&nbsp; In order for a pre-nuptial agreement of this nature to be made binding there needs to be independent legal advice for both parties, full and frank financial disclosure and no duress.&nbsp; If a pre-nuptial agreement of this nature is entered into at the church door then it is open to an allegation that one party or the other has been under a level of duress to enter into the agreement.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Are Post or Pre-Nuptial Agreements binding?</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Prenuptial agreements are common place on mainland Europe but the courts in England and Wales have always been reluctant to have their overall discretion as to how assets should be divided upon divorce tied in by an agreement reached between two parties prior to the marriage taking place.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">A gradual shift towards recognising the validity of pre and post nuptial agreements was brought to a head by the case of&nbsp;Radmacher v. Grantino. This case went to the highest court in the land, The Supreme Court, purely on whether a pre-nuptial agreement entered into by the parties in Germany three months before they married was applicable in law in England and Wales.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">The Supreme Court decided in October 2010 that it was natural to infer that parties entering into agreements of this sort will intend that legal effect would be given to those agreements. Unless the outcome of the pre-nuptial agreement was unfair to any children of the marriage, in which case the court could still ignore or vary the agreement, the agreement would be upheld by the court.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Find out more information on Pre and Post-Nuptial Agreements</h2>\r\n<p>We have&nbsp;offices in Chesterfield, Sheffield, Dronfield, Mansfield, Nottingham, Derby, Ilkeston and Bulwell.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>For more information on Pre and Post-Nupital Agreements, or to arrange an appointment with our expert Family Law solicitors, call&nbsp;<span class="calltracks_bannerjonescouk-main">0330 017 6309</span>*&nbsp;or email <a href="mailto:info@bannerjones.co.uk">info@bannerjones.co.uk</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p>*<strong><sub>calls cost no more than a local 01 number and are included in your mobile minutes.</sub></strong></p>', '2010-11-15 10:35:37', '2015-07-22 10:53:36', 'At Banner Jones we have a large family law team which enables us to respond quickly if you are suffering from domestic violence.

Couples who register have legal status as &ldquo;registered civil partners&rdquo; and acquire a package of civil partnership rights and responsibilities in the same way as a married couple.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">What happens if my Civil Partnership does not work?</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">If the Civil Partnership breaks down then you can apply to the court to have the civil partnership brought to an end after you have been together as civil partners and in a civil partnership for at least one year. This is known as a Dissolution.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">How do I end my Civil Partnership?</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Bringing the civil relationship to an end involves the similar process to having a divorce. A petition is filed asking that the partnership should be brought to a conclusion and showing that the civil partnership has definitely come to an end. &nbsp;The petition will need to be lodged with a County Court that specifically deals with dissolving civil partnerships.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">What basis can the Civil Partnership be ended by the court?</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">The court will accept similar grounds to prove that the civil partnership has come to an end as those of divorcing couples.&nbsp; The ground for dissolution is that the relationship has broken down irretrievably shown by the following facts:-</p>\r\n<ol style="text-align: left;">\r\n<li>Either that your civil partner&rsquo;s behaviour has been so unreasonable you can no longer bear to live with him or her;</li>\r\n<li>That you or your civil partner have lived apart for at least two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition and your partner agrees to a dissolution;</li>\r\n<li>That you and your civil partner have lived apart for at least five years prior to the presentation of the petition and the partner&rsquo;s consent is not required, or;</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp;Your civil partner has deserted you.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">For a desertion petition you will need to have been apart for two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">Can I make financial claims against my civil partner if the Civil Partnership is brought to a conclusion?</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Civil partners can make claims against each other&rsquo;s finances in the same way that heterosexual married couples can.&nbsp; If there are financial issues stemming from your separation and dissolution of the civil partnership you will need to take further detailed advice and we recommend that you contact one of the family team who can give you specific advice in relation to this complex area of law.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;">What if there are children involved in the Civil Partnership?</h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Following a dissolution we can apply to the Courts&nbsp;for orders&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;children issues including residence, contact order and financial provision.

This is a change in emphasis to encourage parents to focus on the arrangements that are made for their children rather than the label given to it.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Child Arrangements Orders are defined as an order regulating arrangements relating to any of the following:</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: left;">\r\n<li>With whom a child is to live, spend time with or otherwise have contact</li>\r\n<li>When a child is to live, spend time or otherwise have contact with any person.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">The two main issues that parents will encounter are therefore still the question of where a child will live or reside and then the time they will spend with the parent that they do not live with.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Who the child/children live with</strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">The way in which the court will approach where a child is to live , if parents cannot agree this, &nbsp;is based upon a careful consideration of the child&rsquo;s needs and what is in their best interests. It is rare for a court to separate siblings but if it is in the children&rsquo;s best interests they will do so. The court now quite often make &ldquo;joint&rdquo; or &ldquo;shared&rdquo; orders with a residence element, so that in effect the child or children will have two homes. The court can even go as far as setting out specific periods of time where the child will live with each parent, such as in the school holidays or during school term time. It can be set out in general terms if the Court is confident that both parties can agree the detail between them.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">A Child Arrangements Order with a &ldquo;residence&rdquo; element prevents:</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: left;">\r\n<li>Altering the name of the child or children;</li>\r\n<li>Removing&nbsp; the child or children from the UK (for more than 28 days);</li>\r\n<li>Consenting to the child&rsquo;s adoption without the agreement of everyone with Parental Responsibility.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>When a child spends time with you both</strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">This is what used to be the &ldquo;contact&rdquo; or &ldquo;access&rdquo; element and settles when a child spends time with someone, usually the parent they do not live with. It is not compulsory to have an order to spend time with your child. These arrangements are usually agreed by both parents. If you are experiencing issues or the person /parent who the child currently lives with is being difficult about facilitating time between you and your child and mediation has not worked or has been assessed as not appropriate, then you can apply for an order with a contact element.</p>\r\n<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Different forms of contact</strong></h2>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">The type of time spent maintaining contact with a child can take many forms, including:</p>\r\n<ul style="text-align: left;">\r\n<li>Letters and emails</li>\r\n<li>Telephone calls</li>\r\n<li>Visiting time</li>\r\n<li>Overnight stays</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Where there is a concern over the level of care the adult wishing to spend time with a child can give, the Court may order a period of supervised time. This is where another adult is present to ensure that the child or children do not come to any harm.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">We have&nbsp;offices in Chesterfield, Sheffield, Dronfield, Mansfield, Nottingham, Derby, Ilkeston and Bulwell.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>For more information on Child Arrangements Orders, or to arrange an appointment with our expert Family Law department, call <span class="calltracks_bannerjonescouk-main">0330 017 6309</span></strong>*<strong>&nbsp;or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@bannerjones.co.uk">info@bannerjones.co.uk</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">*<strong><sub>calls cost no more than a local 01 number and are included in your mobile minutes.</sub></strong></p>', '2014-07-04 11:03:00', '2015-07-22 10:45:48', '', '', 2, 1, 0, NULL, 1, 0, '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', 'family_highlight', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, 'family_highlight', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', 0, '', 'Child  Arrangements Orders ', ''),

The Banner Jones conveyancing team in Chesterfield, Sheffield, Dronfield and Mansfield, have lots of experience with Shared Ownership properties so let us guide you every step of the way.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>How does Shared Ownership work?</strong></h2>\r\n<p>A monthly rent is paid to the landlord in respect of the share you have not purchased.&nbsp; For the percentage share you buy you will normally require a mortgage.&nbsp; Certain lenders do not accept Shared Ownership property but the housing association can normally put you in contact with a mortgage adviser who is used to dealing with this type of application.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Who qualifies for Shared Ownership?</strong></h2>\r\n<p>To qualify for Shared Ownership you must be in employment and be in a position to raise a mortgage for the part you are buying.&nbsp; The amount you must be earning will vary depending on property prices and where you want to live.&nbsp; However, if you have sufficient income to enable you to purchase a home outright then you will not qualify.&nbsp; Priority is normally given to those in need and those on housing waiting lists but each individual housing association has their own requirements.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>What is staircasing?</strong></h2>\r\n<p>In the future you can gradually buy a bigger share in the house and in most schemes you can eventually own it outright.&nbsp; There is no obligation to purchase a larger share but the scheme is designed to be flexible should your circumstances change.</p>\r\n<p>Initially you contact the housing association who will arrange a valuation and will offer you a price to purchase the extra shares.&nbsp; Any improvements you have made to the property will be disregarded in calculating the price of the further shares.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have completed the purchase your rent is reduced accordingly but your mortgage payments may increase.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Will I have to pay a deposit?</strong></h2>\r\n<p>This depends on your finances, but normally yes.&nbsp; If for example you are renting 50% with a mortgage of 45% then a 5% deposit will be payable.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Will it be leasehold or freehold?</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Whether you buy a house or flat your interest in the property will be leasehold because the housing association owns the property and is the landlord.&nbsp; They will grant a Lease, typically 99 or 125 years, and you will be subject to the terms of the Lease.&nbsp;&nbsp; Banner Jones would provide you with a full report of your rights and responsibilities under the terms of the Lease during the transaction.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Do I have to arrange buildings insurance? </strong></h2>\r\n<p>No.&nbsp; That is done by the landlord/housing association and part of the rent payable reimburses the cost of the buildings insurance.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Will there be service charges? </strong></h2>\r\n<p>Not always.&nbsp; If the property&rsquo;s communal areas are maintained by the housing association then yes there will be a service charge.&nbsp; Some Shared Ownership properties do not have a service charge.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>What are the initial costs I will have to pay?</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Owning a home can be expensive and you will need to consider things such as re-decoration, utility bills, fittings and furniture and insurance for the contents of your home.</p>\r\n<p>Other costs you must budget for monthly include mortgage repayments, rent on the proportion of the share you do not own, council tax and any service charge (if applicable).</p>\r\n<p>There are also some initial costs involved in buying a Shared Ownership property just as there is when you buy on the open market and these will need to be paid from your own savings.&nbsp; These include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Stamp Duty</strong> - The calculations as to whether you have to pay Stamp Duty is more complicated with a Shared Ownership property.&nbsp; You can be exempt from paying this if you purchase up to 80% share in the equity.&nbsp; However, if the value of the percentage share you are buying is over &pound;125,000.00 then you will have to pay Stamp Duty.&nbsp; We would discuss the options regarding Stamp Duty with you as part of the transaction. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Deposit</strong> &ndash; if required. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Survey/Valuation</strong> &ndash; This is essentially if you are purchasing a property with a mortgage and is normally arranged through your mortgage broker or lender. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Legal fees</strong> &ndash; This covers the work we do to complete the transaction and it will always be a fixed fee. <a href="../../../page/contact-us" target="_blank">Contact us for a free quote</a>. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>For more information about Shared Ownership, or to arrange an appointment with our expert Conveyancing solicitors, call <span class="calltracks_bannerjonescouk">0330 017 6309</span></strong>*<strong>&nbsp;or emai&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@bannerjones.co.uk">info@bannerjones.co.uk</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">*<strong><sub>calls cost no more than a local 01 number and are included in your mobile minutes.</sub></strong></p>', '2015-06-18 10:19:15', '2015-07-22 11:04:22', '', '', 2, 1, 0, NULL, 1, 0, '<p>Quality Guaranteed</p>\r\n<p>Banner Jones have secured this&nbsp;accreditation for the 2nd year running</p>', '182_Accredited CQ_logo rgb.jpg', 'image/jpeg', 61971, '2015-06-18 10:46:47', '', 'family_highlight', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', '', '', '', '/web/contact_us', '', NULL, 'family_highlight', '', '/web/contact_us', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', 0, '', '', ''),
