    - Cash Flow is King
    - It was announced last week that the UK economy has officially come out of recession with figures for the last three months of 2009 showing growth of 0.1%.
    - |-
      <p>Unemployment figures also fell last week for the first time in 18 months. Despite this encouraging news the reality for most businesses is that things will remain difficult for some time yet. Further factory closures such as Robert Bosch Limited in Wales, provide yet another stark reminder that the UK manufacturing sector, in particular, continues to be under threat from cheaper overseas production.</p>
      <p>The recent tough economic climate has given many business managers the opportunity to review overheads and cut out unnecessary costs. This is often the easiest way to make a business more profitable.&nbsp; One simple yet practical example is to ensure that correspondence is sent electronically rather than by post whenever possible.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>For businesses that do find they are facing insolvency, whereby, a business is unable to pay their debts as and when they fall due, seeking professional advice at the earliest opportunity can help to safeguard the long term future and stability of the business.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When it comes to financial management the phrase <em>&ldquo;cash flow is king&rdquo;</em> is often used and for good reason.&nbsp; Many good businesses fail as a result of poor cash flow management.&nbsp; The key is to monitor both your creditors and debtors carefully; if cash flow becomes problematic speak to creditors early and try to initiate informal arrangements to defer payments temporarily.&nbsp; For example, HM Revenue &amp; Customs have been more prepared to agree deferred payment plans with businesses struggling to pay their tax bills than previously. If your business operates from rented premises then you should consider contacting your landlord with a view to negotiating a reduction in the rent. From a landlord&rsquo;s point of view, agreeing to accept a reduced rent is preferable to having empty premises or having to issue proceedings against a tenant to recover arrears.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>With debtors, be similarly proactive, in the event of a default of payment immediate attempt to negotiate a repayment arrangement should be made.&nbsp; If payments are not been made legal advice should be sought with a view to instigating proceedings.&nbsp; The threat of legal proceedings will often be sufficient for a debtor to make payment.&nbsp; Care should also be taken in not extending significant credit to clients and customers.&nbsp; Whilst fulfilling orders keeps a business busy, you should be careful not to leave yourself overexposed with even the most longstanding of customers.</p>
      <p>For businesses that do get into financial difficulties the options that are available include the following, IVAs&rsquo; (Individual Voluntary Arrangements) &amp; CVAs&rsquo; (Company Voluntary Arrangements). The&nbsp;basic principle of IVAs&rsquo; &amp; CVAs&rsquo; is that the business in difficulty puts a&nbsp;proposal to its creditors to pay them a fixed amount in the pound of the debts owing.&nbsp; If the arrangement is accepted by the creditors then this allows the business to continue with reduced debt levels.&nbsp; Where debt is held individually rather than in a limited company name it can be more troublesome as the personal assets of the business owner, including their home can be under threat.</p>
      <p>Another option is Pre-Pack Administration &ndash; A Pre-Pack Administration is where the managers of an insolvent business agree terms with an Administrator to purchase the assets of the business with the Company being placed into Administration immediately after that.&nbsp; This form of corporate recovery can be controversial as a &lsquo;Phoenix&rsquo; business often begins to trade under a similar name by the same people, from the same premises having written off the debts of the previous business.&nbsp; In those circumstances maintaining trading relationships is often difficult however the other side of this argument is that in many cases, were the action not to have been taken, the business would have failed with the consequent loss of jobs and with creditors left in no better position.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Debt recovery comes in many guises from full scale insolvencies including company voluntary arrangements, partnership and individual voluntary arrangements down to simple debt negotiation and dispute resolution. Don&rsquo;t leave it too late to put your Debt Recovery plan in place because if a business is found to have traded whilst insolvent, then the Directors of that business can be made personally liable for any further debts incurred during that time. Can you take that risk?</p>

    - Family Values
    - "Christmas 2009 may be a distant memory but how many of you shared your Christmas dinner with your business colleagues?  Research shows that around three fifths of UK companies with a turnover up to \xC2\xA35m are in fact family run businesses."
    - |-
      <p>We hear a lot about the struggle to achieve a &ldquo;work life balance&rdquo; but family businesses have been taking their work home for decades. A 2009 survey carried out by South Yorkshire accountants Hawsons revealed that for 44% of family business discussions take place &ldquo;when and wherever&rdquo; and for a further 19% discussions take place &ldquo;at home&rdquo;. The Sunday Lunch Board Meeting is a common phenomenon in the family business; however, this can lead to issues of exclusion for directors, managers and owners who are not family members and also resentment from family members who are not involved in the business.</p>
      <p>Only 30% of family businesses survive to the second generation because sibling rivalry over contentious issues such as share ownership, succession and salaries all get in the way of forward business planning.&nbsp; As a family business grows and different generations start to join many family businesses take the decision to create a Family Charter (sometimes called family constitutions or protocols). This is a written document which creates a framework to support the formal business structures, and typically sets out how the family wishes the business to be run, the family&rsquo;s goals and the long-term strategy, the family&rsquo;s relationships within the business and how the family members should behave towards each other in the context of the business.</p>
      <p>The charter can also cover such issues as, who should be employed in the business? Who should be entitled to sit on the board? What happens if someone wants to sell their shares? And should in-laws be entitled to own shares?</p>
      <p>Having a Family Charter in place can boost overall staff morale through the knowledge that they are fully supported by the family rather than being treated as outsiders.&nbsp;&nbsp; No two Family Charters will be the same, but the process of working together to create a Family Charter can help the family and the business achieve long term growth objectives.</p>
      <p>So where will your family business be at the end of this new decade?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should you be taking stock and seeking professional advice on how to future proof your business?</p>

    - Change of status...
    - Many new business start ups are either sole traders or partnerships but at some stage many of those will become a limited company.   The question is, are you better off being a sole trader or in a partnership rather than being a limited company (Ltd) or limited liability partnership (LLP)?
    - |-
      <p>Quite often the format for running your business will have depended on your personal circumstances at the time of start up, but circumstances change as your business grows and it might be worth reviewing your options. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>One of the major benefits from incorporating your business into a Ltd company/LLP is limited liability. This means that providing the rules are followed individuals will not take on personal liability for contracts and creditors.&nbsp;&nbsp; In these uncertain economic times this is not only an advantage for existing businesses but also for any budding Alan Sugar apprentices setting up a new business.&nbsp; Often a Ltd company will operate a number of separate divisions although these are still all part of the same Ltd company. You could also consider having a group structure.&nbsp; This protects an established profitable business from a new or untested business venture as each part of the group enjoys the protection of limited liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Care must be taken though, where &nbsp;the &lsquo;small profits rate&rsquo; for corporation tax has to be divided between associated companies.</p>
      <p>Roles in the business can be reviewed at this time especially when incorporating an existing partnership business into a Ltd company. This has tax planning benefits, as a shareholding director of a Ltd company can receive a salary, dividends and loan repayments.&nbsp; A &ldquo;silent partner&rdquo; may become a shareholder (&ldquo;investor&rdquo;) but not a director (&ldquo;manager&rdquo;) and key employees can become directors but not shareholders.&nbsp; Employees can &lsquo;participate&rsquo; and have non-voting shares and have a stake in the business without having any control. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>LLPs have been overlooked by many businesses despite the fact that they offer limited liability status with partnership style taxation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LLPs have been popular with many professional businesses which traditionally operated as a partnership, often due to the regulatory requirements of their governing body. &nbsp;We have a number of clients who successfully use both an LLP and Ltd for different aspects of their businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course having several types of business being run alongside one another does require more administration but the benefits can far outweigh the extra costs which may arise. One of the benefits to having both a Ltd company and a partnership is that it allows income sources to adapt quickly and tax efficiently which might be important following some of the potential changes in the first &ldquo;ConDemNation&rdquo; budget.&nbsp; We may see reductions to the small profits rate of corporation tax, changes to tax thresholds, NI rates and various other tweaks to the taxation system. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>There are however some perceived disadvantages to incorporation but this does not discourage over 300,000 new companies being formed every year.&nbsp;&nbsp; The public register at Companies House holds a Ltd&rsquo;s/LLP&rsquo;s accounts, however, as the accounts filing deadline is 9 months after the year end the information in these accounts may be out of date and of limited commercial value.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, it is common for banks, landlords and finance companies to still require personal guarantees whilst the newly formed Ltd company/LLP establishes a credit history.&nbsp; Where possible any personal guarantee should be limited to an agreed sum.&nbsp;&nbsp; In reality you are still better off providing a limited form of personal guarantee than having the unlimited liability associated with sole trader status.&nbsp; In terms of cost it is not expensive to set up a new Ltd company/LLP as the registration fees are just &pound;20 for the DIY route. It is recommended however, that you have a professionally prepared agreement regulating Ltd companies, LLPs and partnerships which will mean that the overall costs will be roughly the same. This is why most people choose to use a specialist solicitor or company formation agent so that they avoid potentially expensive mistakes and get the correct agreements in place from the start.</p>

    - Beware of Copy Cats
    - They say imitation is the best form of flattery, but would you say that if it was your idea being copied and exploited? Businesses who underestimate the need for Intellectual Property (IP) protection may see their market position eroded as 'Me Too' products hit the shelves.
    - |-
      <p>There are four main types of IP rights which you can use to protect your innovations including Trademarks, Designs, Copyrights and Patents.</p>
      <p><strong>Trade marks</strong> are symbols that distinguish goods and services in the marketplace - like logos and brand names. Trademarks prohibit anyone using the logo or brand without authorisation from the owner. &nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Designs</strong> protect items such as the shape of a take-away cup to the body of jet and these prevent rival companies having exact replicas in the market place.</p>
      <p><strong>Copyright</strong> is an automatic right which applies to work that is fixed, such as an original of a novel or article.</p>
      <p><strong>Patents</strong> protect what makes things work &ndash; like the latest gadget or the chemical formula of your favourite fizzy drink.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>It is important that you do not tell anyone about your invention before you apply for a patent, because this may make your patent invalid. However, you can tell qualified (registered) lawyers, solicitors and patent agents because anything you say to or show them is legally privileged. If you need to discuss your invention with someone before you apply for a patent, a <strong>confidentiality disclosure agreement</strong> (CDA) or <strong>non-disclosure agreements</strong> (NDA) can help.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p>Britain&rsquo;s scientific industries have welcomed Chancellor Alistair Darling&rsquo;s introduction of a so-called &lsquo;patent box&rsquo; in the Budget in March. The scheme ring-fences incomes, which have been derived from patents, giving them a more favourable tax treatment. It means that, from 2013, the rate of corporation tax will be cut to just 10 per cent for income which stems from patents in the UK.</p>
      <p>The arrangement, which has already been introduced in countries such as Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belgium, is aimed at encouraging more businesses operating in the fields of intellectual property and innovation to locate in the UK.</p>
      <p>Announcing the measure, Mr. Darling said: &ldquo;This country has a remarkable record of ideas and innovation. We&rsquo;ve won more Nobel prizes than any country of our size. We need to do more to support this ingenuity and ensure this creativity is harnessed in this country. So, following consultation with business, I will introduce a 10 per cent corporation tax rate on income which stems from patents in the UK. This will help maintain jobs in science and technology in this country."</p>

    - Is Your Business Free From Inheritance Tax?
    - Business owners usually try to use a tax efficient structure for their business, the question is which taxes are they trying to minimise? Income and Corporation taxes are top the list so that income can be extracted efficiently. Capital gains tax also on the list, especially for those preparing their business for sale. But what about Inheritance tax (IHT)?
    - |-
      <p>Many business owners will be pleased to learn that they can make use of &ldquo;Business Property Relief&rdquo; which means that HM Revenue &amp; Customs will ignore certain business assets when calculating IHT. There are of course rules but if for the past several years you have owned the shares in your limited company which is a genuine trading company then the chances are that the value of the shares will be ignored when dealing with IHT on your death.</p>
      <p>Many business owners find that they have lost the right to this relief without realising.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the limited company has rented out its business premises with the result that the greater part of the company&rsquo;s income now comes from rental activity rather than trading activities. This may enough to result in the relief being denied or disputed with the result that your executors have to spend time and legal fees challenging tax authority&rsquo;s decision. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>Selling your business can also result in an immediate loss of relief. For those fortunate enough to find a cash buyer then having sold the business you will no longer qualify for the relief &ndash; you now have a cash deposit in your bank account not shares in a trading company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many business sales are structured so that the final purchase price is dependent upon an earn out - the seller continuing to work in the business for an agreed time after the sale. We also see sellers trying to assist buyers with structures allowing the purchase to take place over an extended period of time. The IHT treatment will depend upon what you owned at the date of death &ndash; shares in a trading company or a right to receive payment for those shares at a future date &ndash;&nbsp;and the nature of the business activities undertaken by the company.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The valuable Business Property Relief can be wasted &ndash; if the business assets (which qualify in their own right as exempt from IHT) are left in a Will to an IHT exempt beneficiary (such as a spouse or registered charity) then this is not tax efficient.</p>
      <p>Inheritance tax is rarely at the forefront of anyone&rsquo;s mind when buying, running or selling a business. However with the prospect of a 40% tax bill on the value of your business assets perhaps it is time to review your business structure and draw up your IHT efficient Will, with a qualified solicitor of course.</p>

    - Businesses Need More Than a Crystal Ball
    - How long has your business been around? Will it be here in 10 years? What about 100 years? To learn some lessons about businesses surviving through difficult economic times take a look at your local family owned businesses, particularly those who have survived through 3 or more generations. To survive the transition through several decades requires not only a very long term view but also a desire to ensure that there is a sound business there for the generations to come.
    - |-
      <p>To survive through generations the business obviously needs to have a robust business strategy and we often find that excellence in customer service is often something that distinguishes a family owned business. By looking after and retaining their existing customers rather than constantly trying to acquire new ones has given many family owned businesses a point of difference and solid foundation to work from.</p>
      <p>But this is only one element.&nbsp; All businesses need to ensure they have access to capital.&nbsp;&nbsp; Older family owned businesses are particularly good at maintaining profits and cash in the business. This enables reinvestment into the company and helps maintain balance through turbulent economic times.&nbsp; It helps to have close family relationships with a sense of belonging and also to have no external shareholders demanding dividend returns is an advantage.</p>
      <p>In the knowledge that the business will benefit at the end of the mortgage term, very often we see family owned businesses buying their premises rather than renting. The commercial property market is still very touch but if a business has managed to maintain sufficient cash reserves to enable a sizeable deposit to be put down then purchasing premises is still something to consider to reap &nbsp;those longer term benefits. We also often see family businesses owning their premises separately to the business, which gives them the security that the wealth in the property is separate to the main business should they ever wish to diversify into newer riskier ventures.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Many of our business clients have told us that they are trying to counteract the recession by going back to basics, focusing on looking after their customers, getting the job done quickly (at the right price of course) and making sure they get paid promptly for it. Hopefully we will all remember some of these valuable lessons as the economy struggles back. In the meantime maybe its time to think long term and draw up your 10 and 20 year business plans?</p>

    - The future is in your hands
    - Congratulations to all of those companies featuring in the Top 100 this week, at a time of continued economic turmoil it is great to hear of so many success stories in our region. Most businesses however would probably agree that treading water by maintaining turnover is just as important as increasing turnover at the moment.
    - |-
      <p>Even a loss of turnover could be seen as positive to some as it may reflect a review of business operations, cessation of loss-making divisions or diversification. Trying to ensure that a business is in good shape to trade this year, next year and in 5 years time requires long term strategic planning.</p>
      <p>Some of the best examples of business longevity are family businesses.&nbsp; The names may evolve along with the product ranges but the culture behind the business continues. Many family businesses look to the long term future &ndash; trying to ensure that there will be a business fit for the next generation to take over in 20 years time. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Having a clear understanding about what is expected from the next generation is key. Do your children, nephews and nieces have the automatic right to join the business? Many children are lured into the family business by the promise of a comfortable salary and title status, where all too often the recipient neither has the skills nor experience to warrant this. This can undermine the position of the rest of the senior management team when faced with taking orders from the inexperienced boss&rsquo;s son or daughter.&nbsp; Should you therefore have eligibility criteria for joining the business such as relevant skills training? A family construction business for example would be better served by an architecture or civil engineering qualification, so an agreement as to the further education needs of the next generation may take place whilst they are still at school, ensuring their skills are aligned to the business profile.</p>
      Planning for retirement is something we are all encouraged to think about as soon as we start working, however, family businesses will also need to plan for succession, not just in terms of financing an exit for the current owners but also in terms of ensuring that the next generation have the right attributes for the future success of the business. Just think, with long term plans in place you might be appearing on the 2020 Top 100 companies survey and beyond&hellip;

    - Beat the Mortgage Drought
    - Everything from having a baby to a missed loan payment can scupper a mortgage application. Let me help you to secure a deal. Middle-class homebuyers are finding it harder than ever to secure a mortgage as high street lenders tighten criteria for securing a loan.
    - |-
      <p>Last week, the British Bankers&rsquo; Association (BBA) warned that the number of newloans for house purchases had hit a 19-month low, while total mortgage lending wasat its lowest for a decade. One frustrated broker said that few of his applications forNatWest&rsquo;s best-buy two-year tracker, with a rate of 1.99%, had been approved. Thebank then came back with question marks on every single one. One broker said that onlyabout 10% of clients meet the requirements set by lenders for new borrowers. Peopleare now not even bothering to apply for a mortgage as they feel their chances of gettingaccepted are just too slim.</p>
      <p>There are currently 972 mortgage deals available from the biggest seven lenders &mdash; HSBC, RBS (including NatWest), Lloyds Banking Group (including Halifax), Barclays,Santander (including Abbey and Alliance &amp; Leicester), Northern Rock and Nationwidebuilding society &mdash; compared with 411 in 2006, according to Moneyfacts, the data provider. However, while the number of mortgages available has risen, applications being approved have slumped. The BBA figures show 70,895 loans were approved lastmonth, against 195,976 in 2006. Some borrowers who have secured a deal are havingfinance withdrawn at the eleventh hour after they have paid valuation and applicationfees. Agreements in principle (AIPs) are traditionally provided by lenders after an initialcredit check and assessment of a borrower&rsquo;s application, giving the green light to payvaluers and lawyers. However, AIPs are becoming less reliable and people shouldn&rsquo;tassume that they will still stand in two months.</p>
      <p>The sickly state of the mortgage market continues to push down house prices, which fell0.8% last month, according to the Land Registry. Here&rsquo;s how borrowers at every stage ofthe housing market have been hit by the squeeze and how they can secure the best deal.</p>
      <h2>Applying For a Loan</h2>
      <p>The mortgage drought is forcing middle-class borrowers to seek pricier loans fromalternative &ldquo;sub-prime&rdquo; lenders. There are now a number of such lenders includingKensington, Aldermore and Precise, which joined the market with new deals last week.Melton Mowbray building society also improved its deals in the past few days. Lendingconstraints on the high street are forcing creditworthy high earners to use alternativefirms that charge higher rates. These lenders will accept applications from borrowerswith county court judgments (CCJs) or missed loan repayments. However, one lendersaid that an increasing number of their customers are high earners who have been shutout of the mainstream market. The average new borrower earns &pound;42,000 a year, withone in ten earning more than &pound;60,000. In 2007, it was mainly cash-poor borrowerswho turned to alternative lenders.</p>
      <p>Precise introduced three-year capped tracker-rate loans last week for borrowers withone payment default in the past three years. It charges those with a 25% deposit avariable rate of 5.26%, pegged to Libor &mdash; the rate at which banks lend to eachother &mdash; and capped at 8.25%, with a 1.5% fee. By contrast, Chelsea buildingsociety has a three-year fixed rate at just 3.29% with a &pound;995 fee, available toborrowers with a 25% deposit. The increased use of computerised underwritingprocedures at the biggest lenders means that any blip on a credit report history,however minor, could lead to a rejection. However, borrowers without a spotlesshistory should not have to go straight to alternative lenders. Brokers say those thatuse human underwriters, rather than computer credit scoring, are more likely tooverlook blips.</p>
      <p>A handful of lenders, including the Post Office and Nationwide building society, stilloffer interest-only deals for borrowers with a 10% deposit. Those who have secureda mortgage offer should ask the lender about any impending changes in lendingpolicy that might affect their agreement in principle. Banks and building societiesusually complete a second credit check in the days before the loan is made, so anychanges to your credit file since the original agreement in principle was providedcould lead to the offer being pulled.</p>

    - What are We Doing to First Time Buyers?
    - "I have been concerned for some time over new Financial Services Authority (FSA) regulations to restrict mortgage availability. These concerns are beginning to come more to the fore. Mortgage lending will be \xC2\xA39 billion this year, compared with \xC2\xA341 billion in 2008."
    - |-
      <p>Half of all first-time buyers could be denied the mortgage theywant under planned restrictions that are causing deep concern across government.Plans from the FSA will mean mortgage applicants undergoing &ldquo;affordabilityassessments&rdquo; to show that they can pay significantly more than the cost of themortgage they want to take out.</p>
      <p>Proposals to restrict the terms of mortgages to 25 years and an end to &ldquo;selfcertification&rdquo;loans, which allow the self-employed to declare their income, are alsobeing considered. Interest-only mortgages will come under review next year. First-timebuyers already face serious obstacles to home ownership. Lenders are demandingsubstantial deposits and refusing loans or increasing interest rates for those who cannotraise them. I heard this week that ministers are deeply concerned that the pendulum infavour of regulation may have swung too far, storing up the potential for economic andsocial problems at a time when lending is already at a ten-year low. First-time buyersand those struggling with repayments are particularly vulnerable to the threat of higherinterest rates in the new year.</p>
      <p>The number of first-time buyers in the three months to September was 5 per cent lowerthan in the same period of 2009, as most lenders continue to shun those with a 10 percent deposit or charge exorbitant premiums of between 3 and 5 per cent. TheGovernment insists the rise in tuition fees to be decided this week, potentially saddlinggraduates with &pound;40,000 of debt, will not have an impact on their ability to borrow, butsome mortgage brokers have called this into question. Ministers believe the FSA iswrong to suggest that the changes will have a tiny impact on mortgage take-up, andthe Treasury is being warned that new regulations would encourage excessively riskaverse decision-making by banks. They have seized on Council of Mortgage Lenders(CML) estimates that show that under the proposals, 60 per cent of first-time buyerswould have been affected if the rules had been in place between 2005 and 2009. TheCML also calculates that 45 per cent of first-time buyers granted mortgages in the firsthalf of this year would have been rejected or allowed to borrow only a lesser amount ifthe mortgage rules had been in force. Overall, CML figures show that mortgage lendingwill be &pound;9 billion this year, compared with &pound;41 billion in 2008 and &pound;110 billion in 2006,as banks struggle to rebuild their balance sheets. However, the FSA has pointed out thatthe 350,000 borrowers in arrears and the 54,000 repossessions last year meant that itmust ensure that there was no return to risky lending.</p>
      <p>Two major charities, Citizens Advice and Shelter, said they supported the FSA&rsquo;s proposalsto introduce tough income and affordability checks on mortgage borrowers. An FSAspokeswoman said it was aware of the sensitivity of the issue. &ldquo;We are not rushing orimplementing changes right now, and we are incredibly mindful of the impact.&rdquo;Mark Hoban, the Treasury Minister, has told the Commons that he believes the FSA mustlook &ldquo;very carefully at the impact on home ownership and particularly on those peoplewho are looking to move shortly&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>Grant Shapps, the Housing Minister, said he did not want the FSA micro-managing themarket. &ldquo;I welcome this review of the mortgage market, not least because we can seehow terribly things went wrong in the past,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is crucial, however, to ensurethat the review addresses the problems of the future, rather than trying to fix the gaping holes of the past.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, said: &ldquo;We must have amortgage market that is capable of responding to the increasing diversity and flexibilityof the UK labour market. Care is required to make sure we don&rsquo;t lose the competitionof the marketplace, particularly at this time. Better to get it right than rush it.&rdquo;</p>

    - Speed Up Eviction Plea Backed By 5,000 Signatures
    - |-
      A petition demanding changes in the current legal system for evicting tenants has been handed in to Downing Street. It was signed by almost 5,000 landlords after a campaign by Paul Shamplina, founder of eviction specialists Landlord Action, and the Residential Landlords Association, together with Sussex MP Mike
      Weatherley. The petition is aimed at speeding up the eviction process when there is clear evidence of anti-social behaviour or arrears on the part of the tenants.
    - |-
      <p>The landlords are also seeking changes to the law to improve their rights ofaccess to their property, and they want assurances that the proposed closures of54 county courts will not adversely affect landlords. Alan Ward, chairman of theResidential Landlords Association, said: &ldquo;Landlords depend on the county courtsto dispense justice when tenants fail to pay the rent. If these courts are closed,we call on the Secretary of State for Justice to ensure that landlords and tenantsare not disadvantaged by delays in the court system.&rdquo; Paul Shamplina, ofLandlord Action, said: &ldquo;The private rented sector is growing and the Governmentneeds landlords to plug the shortfall in housing stock. Therefore, it&rsquo;s vital thatthere is a legal framework that properly supports them and encouragesinvestment within this sector.&rdquo; Mike Weatherley said: &ldquo;I wholeheartedly supportthis entirely sensible plan to balance the rights of landlords and tenants. It is alltoo easy to forget that landlords can be mistreated, just as tenants can be.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>What they haven&rsquo;t covered off is the issue of Housing Benefit. It used to be thecase that Councils would pay the rent of someone receiving Housing Benefitdirect to the Landlord. Now rent is paid to the Tenant. If they don&rsquo;t pay they haveto be 2 months in arrears before you can take action. That to me is insanity andif we are to prepare for a property market driven by rent rather than mortgagesthen the rules need to be changed. Former racing driver Sir Stirling Moss, alandlord with 40 properties, recently had to go through the full legal process toevict tenants who had not paid rent for seven months. They eventually left onthe eve of eviction by bailiffs, taking with them crockery, utensils, furniture andbed linen. Moss said: &ldquo;I consider myself a good landlord who is always fair, andI think the law is weighted against decent landlords like myself.&rdquo;</p>
      <h2>Renting Costs More Than Buying In Most Of Britain</h2>
      <p>Renting is now more expensive than buying in eight out of ten UK towns and cities.The figure is up from 74% in July as asking prices have come down and rentshave increased. On average, rents are now 9.9% more than mortgage payments.Research by Zoopla compares current asking prices to average rents for twobedroomflats in the 50 largest cities and towns around the country. Mortgagepayments were calculated assuming an interest-only mortgage at 5% p.a. In somelocations, the extra cost of renting is staggering. In York, rents exceed mortgagepayments by 39%: with average monthly rents at &pound;978, York tenants are &pound;3,270a year worse off than if they were buying. In a further 13 of the largest 50 citiesand towns, rents exceed mortgage payments by more than 20%.</p>
      <h2>Tenants Who Can't Afford To Buy Squeezed By Rising Rents</h2>
      <p>I'm&nbsp;not sure the rental market in Chesterfield is as buoyant as it is nationally.Generally rents appear to have reduced over the last two years rather thanincreased. However, four in ten tenants believe rents will be higher in 12 months&rsquo;time. A Rightmove survey of 2,636 current and prospective tenants also showsthat 55% of tenants would like to buy a home now, but cannot afford to do so.Only 13% said they had no interest in home ownership. Meanwhile, with rentalstock down 23% compared with a year ago, Rightmove says there is chance ofa let-up in rent rises. Commercial director Miles Shipside said that are cases ofgazumping in some areas, and he described some tenants as &ldquo;trapped renters&rdquo;.He said they were unable to get on the housing ladder because of high depositsand credit scoring criteria. The survey shows that one in three tenants plan tostay in rented accommodation for at least three years.</p>

    - Eight reasons why YOU need a will
    - "It is amazing \xE2\x80\x93 and worrying \xE2\x80\x93 to think that around 2/3 of adults in England and Wales do not have a Will. Making a Will need not be complicated or expensive. Although you can make a Will yourself, using a pack bought from the high street, we would strongly suggest you see a solicitor to have it drawn up professionally. We like to compare it to do-it-yourself dentistry \xE2\x80\x93 whilst it may be possible it is probably not a good idea for most people!"
    - |-
      <div class="WordSection1">
      <p>Here are just 8 of the many reasons why you should make a Will&hellip;</p>
      <p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>You control what happens</strong></p>
      <p>If you don&rsquo;t make a Will, the &ldquo;Intestacy Rules&rdquo; govern how your estate is divided up when you die. They determine which of your relatives receives how much and can lead to some nasty surprises. For example, your husband or wife may not inherit everything &ndash; perhaps not even all of your house. With a Will, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> decide who inherits what &ndash; You can take control.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Provide for friends or partners</strong></p>
      <p>The Intestacy Rules do not provide at all for your friends or even for a partner who you may have lived with for years &ndash; they will inherit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nothing</span>. By making a Will, you can leave them as much or as little as you like. It&rsquo;s your money &ndash; it&rsquo;s your decision!</p>
      <p><strong>3. Look after your children</strong></p>
      <p>You can name guardians to look after your children if anything were to happen to you. The choice of guardians is up to you, but a solicitor can advise you on the factors to consider when making this important decision.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Provide for your step-children</strong></p>
      <p>Under the Intestacy Rules, your step-children are not counted as your children and will inherit nothing &ndash; even if their other parents have already died. You can change this &ndash; make a Will and you can be certain their future is secure.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Stop teenagers blowing the lot!</strong></p>
      <p>If you don&rsquo;t have a Will, anything which your children inherit passes to them at the age of 18. Teenage years are not necessarily the best time for someone to come into a sum of money! By making a Will, you can determine when your children (or grandchildren) will inherit, safeguarding the money for a time when they may really need it.</p>
      <p><strong>6. Save Inheritance Tax</strong></p>
      <p>Although the rules have changed recently, you shouldn&rsquo;t get carried away by the headlines. It can still be possible to save thousands of pounds of Inheritance Tax by making sure your Will is tax efficient.</p>
      <p><strong>7. Give to charity</strong></p>
      <p>The Intestacy Rules don&rsquo;t allow for any gifts to charity out of your estate. By making a Will you can leave a set amount or a percentage of your total estate. It&rsquo;s a great way to say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; for the wonderful work they do &ndash; and it helps to save Inheritance Tax too!</p>
      <p><strong>8. Give yourself peace of mind</strong></p>
      <p>Leaving a Will means you can be sure that everything would be dealt with in the way you would wish following your death. It&rsquo;s a great feeling to know that you won&rsquo;t be leaving your loved ones with a mess to sort out.</p>
      <p><strong>Why wait any longer?</strong></p>

    - "Most people don\xE2\x80\x99t realise this, but if you have to move into a care home and your primary need is for nursing as opposed to personal care, then it is possible that your care should be FREE."
    - |-
      <p>When an elderly person is being discharged from hospital, they go through a &ldquo;screening process&rdquo; which decides whether they can safely go back home, or whether a fuller assessment of their needs is required. The fuller assessment looks at 11 different areas of the person&rsquo;s health and their care needs to decide where is the best place for them to live. This includes looking at their mobility, their breathing, their continence, their mental state etc. There are 4 possible outcomes of the assessment &ndash; the person could return home, move into residential care, need residential care with some nursing, or need full nursing care. If the person is assessed as needing the last of these options then the costs of their care will be paid in full by the NHS. If any of the other 3 outcomes are reached, then the elderly person is likely to be assessed as to how much they should pay towards the cost of that care.</p>
      <p>Sometimes mistakes are made in these assessments, or the complicated means-testing rules are not followed correctly. This can mean that some people end up paying more for their care than they need to.</p>
      <p>DID YOU KNOW... you can challenge the decision if you are not happy with it? We can advise you on the rules that should have been applied and can help you to appeal against a decision. We can represent you at panel meetings or can liaise with the Primary Care Trust or the Local Authority on your behalf. Don&rsquo;t feel that once the decision has been made it can&rsquo;t be changed. Many solicitors (Banner Jones included) can do this sort of work on a &ldquo;no win, no fee&rdquo; basis. Expert solicitors can steer you through what can seem like minefields of complaints and appeals procedures to make sure that you and your family don&rsquo;t lose out.</p>
      <p>Even if your loved one has sadly died whilst in care, it might be worth discussing their case with us, as it is sometimes possible to review decisions which were made some time ago and re-claim thousands of pounds of care fees which should never have been paid out.</p>
      Whatever point you are at along this journey, find out today whether you are able to make a claim.

    - Do you own or run a business? Got a contingency plan?
    - "If you have a business, a partnership or are a company director then you should consider appointing a Power Of Attorney. This allows you to delegate decision-making to your attorney if for any reason you can\xE2\x80\x99t be there to make the decisions yourself. You can limit their power to a specific time frame and also limit the decisions they are able to make for you. For example, if a lease for new premises needs to be signed on the 29th of the month, when you will be in the south of France, you can nominate someone to have power to sign that specific lease on that specific day."
    - |-
      <p>You can also give a much wider power to someone like your business partner. This would mean they can step into your shoes whenever they are needed to sign papers or make decisions at any point in the future, say if you were ill. In fact, when 2 or 3 people are in business together this would be a sensible step to take, to ensure business continuity.</p>
      <p>Appointing an attorney can be important in your personal life as well, particularly if you have lots of assets/investments. What if something happened to you tomorrow and you could no longer write a cheque, or sort out your direct debits, even get cash out of the bank... what would you do? People can lose the ability to do all these things in all sorts of ways &ndash; a skiing accident, a car crash, a stroke, dementia or even a routine stay in hospital!</p>
      <p>By creating a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) you can choose someone you trust to take charge of your finances if you need them to. You can choose more than one person if you like, or one person with a &ldquo;back up&rdquo;, just in case. The LPA must be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian before it can be used. But once that has been done, it can take effect whenever and as often as you need it. It can last for the rest of your life or whatever other timescale you choose.</p>
      <p>Obviously, by giving someone power to look after your finances like this there are risks. Your attorney would have complete control and could sell your house and all your assets. There are 2 main ways of safeguarding against this. Firstly, when the LPA is registered you can choose up to 5 people who must be told. These people can act as &ldquo;whistleblowers&rdquo; and speak up if they suspect anything is amiss. Secondly, you can place restrictions on your LPA to prevent your attorney from doing certain things. We would however, always urge caution on restrictions though as your circumstances can change and what might not be appropriate now, may be necessary in the future. For example, you might not want your attorney to be able to sell your house right now. But what if 10 years from now you had a stroke and needed residential care? It might be essential that they have power to sell your house in those circumstances.</p>
      <p>To be able to set up a LPA you must have the necessary understanding of what is involved. Sadly, many people leave it too late and come to us &ndash; or, rather, their families do - to set one up when they have advanced memory problems or dementia. If you don&rsquo;t have the necessary &lsquo;mental capacity&rsquo; then you can&rsquo;t create a LPA. How many times do we hear &ldquo;Oh, if only we had come to you sooner&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
      <p>So don&rsquo;t leave it too late. We like to think of a LPA like an insurance policy. We hope you will never need to use it, but you will have the peace of mind of knowing it is there just in case.</p>

    - "School fees at some private secondary schools are often in the region of \xC2\xA310,000 a year; and if we assume that a child spends 7 years there it is realistic to expect the total cost per child to approach \xC2\xA3100,000 once you factor in additional costs such as uniforms, books and trips."
    - |-
      <p>We see an increasing number of grandparents assisting or fully funding these fees. The death of trusts for grandchildren has been widely reported over recent years but as quoted by Mark Twain, reports of their death may have been exaggerated. Certainly the tax treatment of trusts has become more onerous but for each grandparent wishing to set aside a maximum of say &pound;100,000 which will be &ldquo;used up&rdquo; by the time the grandchild reaches the age of 18, tax treatment may not be as significant as press reports would have us believe.</p>
      <p>The creation of a discretionary trust for the benefit of grandchildren can still be a useful tool.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the selection of appropriate trustees grandparents can have the assurance that this pot of money is ring fenced and can only be used for certain purposes and not by the parents of the grandchildren.</p>
      <p>Treating your grandchildren fairly (rather than equally) may also be an issue, as it is possible that some of your grandchildren may need your support more than others. On the other side of the family there maybe other sets of grandparents who are willing to assist with school fees and you might want to take this into account so wealth is shared fairly.&nbsp; By using independent trustees you can ensure fairness is taken into account when making decisions about fees in the future.</p>
      <p>Grandparents are often concerned that without their continuing financial assistance a grandchild&rsquo;s school fees could not be paid without some element of hardship on their children. Whilst grandparents may be happy to set up direct payments to the schools during their lifetime consideration should also be given to how payments can continue to be made in the event of their death.</p>
      <p>Our advice to grandparents will always focus initially on their own future financial needs. With the death of a spouse the household income may reduce &ndash; particularly if payments from an occupational scheme reduce by 50% to the surviving spouse. However in the event of the death of both grandparents then consideration may be given to making a further lump sum payment into the trust for their grandchildren rather than leaving all of the assets to their children (the parents).</p>
      <p>So as the new school term gets underway it is perhaps time for grandparents to do their own homework and make an appointment with a solicitor.</p>

    - Your Digital Legacy - Better to be Safe than Sorry
    - With Internet usage in the UK at its highest ever levels and growing, perhaps it's time for people to give some consideration to the protection of their digital assets? 30.1 million UK adults access the internet every day, using sites such as Facebook and Twitter for social purposes but also transactional sites such as E-bay for the sale of goods for money.
    - |-
      <p>Nobody likes to think about their death which is why only 1/3rd of UK adults have actually written a Will, but it might be that you have hundreds or even thousands of pounds of digital assets in PayPal or other sites which you might want to ensure pass on to your family or friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every individual website will have its own policy on this, but the general rule is that access will not be given to your next of kin unless they have your passwords or account information. Some would say this is a good thing as they want their confidentiality protected even after death so that family members for example cannot read your e-mails posthumously.</p>
      <p>In 2005 in the US, the parents of a marine killed in Iraq took Yahoo! to court in order to gain access to his e-mail account. They wanted to create a scrapbook of his life, using his e-mails. Yahoo! argued that their terms and conditions did not allow e-mail accounts to be transferred to the next of kin. The court ordered Yahoo! to hand over the e-mails in this case, but the legal issues involved were never properly resolved.</p>
      <p>Companies are starting to emerge in the US to deal with this (for a fee), but most people &ndash; and some internet companies - just haven&rsquo;t thought about it at all. Until the law is clarified, there is a great deal of uncertainty about where things stand. In the UK, data protection laws only apply to living people, so practice varies from company to company and there is no uniform approach. The copyright in your e-mails and photos would legally pass to your executors but what good is that if they don&rsquo;t have the passwords to access them?</p>
      <p>To help, Banner Jones Solicitors&rsquo; have written some top tips to help you manage your digital legacy. Your priority is to write a Will and make sure you include your digital assets in your Will. If you don&rsquo;t and there is a conflict between your Will and other arrangements, your Will will always take precedence. Then, create a list of your online accounts, memberships, passwords etc and decide which account is to pass to whom. Specify on that list if any of your accounts are to be deleted after your death.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve seen examples of deceased&rsquo;s Facebook accounts being left open giving their friends and relatives the opportunity to leave memorial messages, but if you don&rsquo;t want this to happen then you will need to specify that your account be closed in your Will. Nominate a &ldquo;digital executor&rdquo; in your Will to handle the transfer of your accounts after your death. This doesn&rsquo;t have to be the same person as the one who deals with your &ldquo;real&rdquo; assets. Your digital executor would then have the right to access your accounts.&nbsp; Anyone who isn&rsquo;t a digital executor could be on shaky ground legally speaking if they try to access your accounts without the right to do so. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>Another thing to think about and include in your Will are the details of any online billing sites that you use i.e. for mobile phones and online services.&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be difficult to establish the liabilities on death and cancel the services if the executors do not know who the deceased bought services from. The estate may end up with unnecessary bills if the accounts/services aren&rsquo;t terminated and not all organisations will agree to cancel charges from the date of death. These bills will come off the total estate so it&rsquo;s better to get these sorted as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Planning for the future in such a way is never something high on most people&rsquo;s priorities but perhaps it should be and more importantly perhaps this is something you want to point out to your parents. Silver surfers are becoming increasingly active and many will have a mix of both traditional and on line accounts, so it might be worth making sure they have not only written a Will but within the Will have detailed all of their digital assets so that they are not lost forever.</p>

    - Facebook Fuels Divorce
    - "Gone are the days of having to hire a private investigator to prove a cheating spouse, evidence of a partner\xE2\x80\x99s infidelity could now be found literally at your fingertips.  Modern technology such as the mobile phone and the internet is believed to be fuelling divorce in the UK.  I have to say, it is not uncommon now for clients to come in and see me with copies of incriminating text messages, details of emails that they have discovered and even video evidence of an infidelity captured on a video phone."
    - |-
      <p>Social networking sites such as Facebook and Bebo have also had a part to play in this as we keep our friends up to date with our news and gossip through &lsquo;wall posts&rsquo; rather than simply picking up the phone.&nbsp; These trails of messages left between friends can all be used as evidence and interestingly, sites such as Facebook have been quoted by an on-line provider of divorce petitions as being mentioned in around a fifth of all of their unreasonable behaviour divorce cases.</p>
      <p>So, is modern technology leading to an increase in the divorce rate or is this just a case of new technology simply highlighting the age old problem of infidelity?&nbsp; The divorce rate in the UK is one of the highest in Europe, but I know that we are not the only country in Europe to have access to social networking sites and modern forms of communication.&nbsp; I believe that, in reality, these revelations are likely to be the symptom of a relationship in difficulty rather than the initial cause.</p>
      <p>However, not all divorce petitions are instigated by new technology, as an article in the Daily Mail showed earlier this year.&nbsp; This was the case of an Arab Ambassador who obtained an instant divorce in Dubai when he found that his veil-wearing fianc&eacute;, and then wife, had a beard and was cross-eyed.&nbsp; It appears as though he claims to Sharia Court that the woman&rsquo;s parents sent his own mother and father pictures of her far more attractive sister.&nbsp;</p>
      If your relationship is breaking down and you need some advice please contact either myself, Toby Netting at our Sheffield office (01142 755266) or Helena Downing at our Chesterfield office (01246 209773).&nbsp; We are both highly experienced family solicitors with Banner Jones and will be happy to advise in relation to any family matter.

    - A Divorce is for life... not just for Christmas
    - "If getting a divorce happens to be one of your New Year\xE2\x80\x99s resolutions then you won\xE2\x80\x99t be alone. It\xE2\x80\x99s a sad fact that the number of separations and divorces increase after Christmas each year.  Family solicitors up and down the UK are approached by unhappy and disgruntled partners and spouses who, having survived a miserable festive season are now looking for advice on how to start the New Year afresh."
    - |-
      <p>If you are in this position and want to get the ball rolling, it is essential that such an important decision is taken after having had the benefit of clear, concise and objective legal advice.&nbsp; Remember, a divorce is for life and not just for Christmas and, as such, you need to be certain of getting the right advice and the assistance that you need, after all there&rsquo;s no going back.</p>
      <p>By seeking advice early you will gain an understanding of what your options are and there likely outcomes.&nbsp; Once you have these you should choose the mechanism for reaching an agreement that is best suited to you.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is so important to set the overall tone right from the outset, within which your divorce or separation is dealt with.&nbsp; We know that no two couples are the same and we&rsquo;ll listen to your individual circumstances before advising you which is the best route to take.</p>
      <p>The Family Department here at Banner Jones has the full breadth of experience and the ability to offer whichever process is best suited to you.&nbsp; Whether you choose to resolve your issues through mediation, the relatively new collaborative process or the more traditional solicitor/client route, all of these are available to you through our family team.&nbsp; We can also offer you a choice with regard to the gender of your advisor which can be a very important factor for some, and to make the process even more convenient we have a choice of six offices across North East Derbyshire and South Yorkshire.</p>

    - Double Trouble
    - Dealing with the division of assets following divorce or separation can be stressful enough but can you imagine the added pressures and difficulties that arise when one or both of the separating parties are involved in a family business?
    - |-
      <p>In the United   Kingdom, some 75% of all businesses in the private sector are family owned and/or run.&nbsp; It is calculated that around half of the entire workforce is employed by a business of this nature.&nbsp; It follows therefore, that divorce and separation between couples where there is a family business element is quite commonplace.</p>
      <p>In order to recognise the different needs of these couples, an understanding as to the unique nature of a family business, the additional pressures on those involved and the considerations they have to make, not only for themselves but also for the wider family, is essential.&nbsp; One of the biggest concerns for people involved in a family business is that business disagreements can put a strain on family relationships.&nbsp; The reverse is also true and disagreements in family relationships can also put a strain on business agreements. This is not only likely to have an impact on the wider family, but the work force and the business as a whole.</p>
      <p>Each family is unique and every family business is unique.&nbsp; What is required, if you find yourself in a position where you are facing a possible separation or divorce, and working in a family business, is a flexible approach coupled with an understanding of the pressures involved.</p>
      <p>We at Banner Jones are able to offer the full breadth of dispute resolution procedures to our matrimonial clients, coupled with a specialisation in advising family businesses and a commitment to supporting these and other business types across the region. Whether your question is related to matrimonial problems or centres around business succession or governance issues, we can help.</p>

      <p>There is a tragic inevitability that during 2011 many businesses will experience financial difficulties. Often these impact not only on the trading position of the business itself but also on the lives of the business owners.</p>
      <p>At Banner Jones, we have the benefit of many years of experience in dealing with business turnaround and insolvency. We will look for the most effective rescue package for the business to enable it to go forwards either to be sold or run by a newly invigorated owner.</p>
      <p>The solutions we are able to offer are available to all types of business including individuals trading in person as well as limited companies.</p>
      <p>Our solutions include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Full scale Insolvencies including Company Voluntary Arrangements</li>
      <li>Liquidation</li>
      <li>Partnership and Individual Voluntary Arrangements</li>
      <li>Simple debt negotiation and dispute resolution. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Company Voluntary Arrangements (CVAs)</h2>
      <p>This is a process where a proposal is put to the company&rsquo;s creditors and if 75% of the value of those who vote are in favour of the proposal then all of the company&rsquo;s unsecured debt is rolled into the arrangement. Normally the company will then pay a monthly amount for a period of 5 years to satisfy the debt in full. More often than not the total amount paid is less than the total amount owed.</p>
      <p>This can be a very effective solution and avoids the company going into any form of liquidation. Therefore it continues as a going concern and its trading position need not be effected. Often the voluntary arrangement includes the appointment of a company Administrator and therefore often people associate this process with Administration.</p>
      <h2>Liquidation</h2>
      <p>Where a company has passed the point of no return it is often better to place the company into liquidation and bring it to an end. Often the company will have a business and assets which can be sold to a new company and therefore a &ldquo;Phoenix&rdquo; new company can purchase the business and assets and trade free of the old debt. This is a process which is frequently used and entirely in accordance with the Insolvency Act 1986.</p>
      <h2>Company Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>Often the company is in debt or in trouble due to disputed debts. Therefore your Business can work in association with its panel of solicitors to challenge the claim which is made in relation to the outstanding debts.</p>
      <h2>Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVAs)</h2>
      <p><strong>Partnership/Individual Voluntary Arrangements</strong></p>
      <p>Where debt is held personally rather than in a limited company name it can be more troublesome. This is principally for the reason that the personal assets of the business owner, including their home, can be under threat.</p>
      <p>A partnership voluntary arrangement is used where there are more than one business owners trading in partnership and an individual voluntary arrangement is used for one person alone. Equally a series of individual voluntary arrangements can be used and this can often be the case in relation to either business partners or other partners.</p>
      <p>In the same way as a company voluntary arrangement 75% of the value of those who vote need to vote in favour of any proposal. Most proposals again involve monthly payments over a 5 year period after which time the debt is discharged in full. It is not normal to use this solution if the debts are for less than &pound;15,000. It is a useful tool as it avoids bankruptcy and protects personal assets.</p>

      <p>Here are some things that you will need to consider carefully during the formation of your business.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The      company structure, Sole Trader, LLP or Ltd company?</li>
      <li>The      choice of Company name.&nbsp; Your      trading/brand name may be different to your registered company name for      tax purposes.</li>
      <li>The      preparation of memorandum and Articles of Association</li>
      <li>The      buying of the Company</li>
      <li>The      registering of Domain Names for websites</li>
      <li>Sorting      out the Company Secretary and Directors. With Directors Duties and Liabilities becoming more onerous all the      time it is vital that the relevant Companies and Insolvency Legislation is      complied with.</li>
      <li>The      issue of Share Capital.</li>
      <li>Protecting      your Intellectual Property. We can help you apply for patents or      registration marks if required.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It isn&rsquo;t always new companies who need advice on Company Formation, often we see Companies involved in mergers, takeovers, management buyouts and purchasers that need to ensure the change is structured in the best way possible. As part of this we can advise on share transfers and restructuring.</p>

      <p>We can advise you on:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Contracts, including confidentiality clauses and restrictive covenants</li>

      <p>We would always recommend an annual employment health check which will ensure your contracts are all up to date and worth the paper they are written on.&nbsp; Employers often believe their staff contracts are watertight but in reality often they are not due to more recent changes in the Law. If in doubt please check with our employment expert.</p>

      <h2>What is TLC?</h2>
      <p>Total Legal Care (TLC) gives your business a local solicitor &lsquo;on demand&rsquo;, backed up with legal insurance at an affordable fixed monthly cost. Whilst your dedicated Banner Jones solicitor provides you with day to day legal advice (whenever you need it) the insurance part of the scheme is designed to give you comfort in the knowledge that your business is protected from any unexpected legal costs and awards of compensation against you. Most would agree a known monthly cost beats a large future cost every time!</p>
      <p>TLC covers you against:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Contract      disputes</li>
      <li>Bad      debts </li>
      <li>Compliance      and regulation</li>
      <li>Employment      disputes</li>
      <li>Employment      compensation</li>
      <li>Property      protection</li>
      <li>Tax      protection </li>
      <li>And      much more&hellip;.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Prevention is always cheaper than cure (ask any doctor) and in an age of litigation the chances of being involved in an expensive excursion to the courts is not longer remote (employment claims tribunals have increased by 40% since the credit crunch began).&nbsp; Legal representation can cost thousands of pounds, even if you win.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Take surprises off your balance sheet by giving your business a little TLC.&nbsp; TLC is a legal breakdown, assistance and recovery service for businesses and its directors. You insure your car and buildings against damages so why not insure your bottom line?</p>
      <h2>Why do you need it?</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>You can call your dedicated commercial solicitor for advice at any time (now that&rsquo;s something you won&rsquo;t hear very often!) and most of your legal advice and potential costs will either be pre-paid or covered by your TLC insurance policy. Unless you can ring-fence legal costs the impact of a legal action hanging over your business could force cost-cutting, stop a sale, prevent a dividend being paid or even force you into bankruptcy. TLC allows you to plan ahead for profit</li>
      <li>TLC is unique because the advice comes from a Banner Jones solicitor retained by you.&nbsp; Your legal claim is assessed by your solicitor, not someone at a call centre who doesn&rsquo;t even know your business</li>
      <li>TLC provides legal funding for both the pursuit and defence of your rights</li>
      <li>Both the business entity AND the individual directors are covered unlike many policies</li>
      <li>We start the ball rolling with an immediate employment procedure health check and ongoing we will ensure that you are up to date with the latest laws, compliance directives and regulations</li>
      <li>You might be thinking &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve already got free legal expenses cover with our business insurance&rsquo;, well just to warn you, if you do, you will probably be told that you are not entitled to claim on the policy because you have already invalidated it by not following the correct procedures. The procedures that TLC will ensure you are aware of from the beginning</li>
      </ul>

    - Balance sheet insolvency Having negative net assets &ndash; in other words, liabilities exceed assets. A business may be 'cash flow insolvent' but 'balance sheet solvent' if it holds illiquid assets, particularly against short term debt that it cannot immediately realize if called upon to do so. Conversely, a business can have negative net assets showing on its balance sheet but still be cash flow solvent if ongoing revenue is able to meet debt obligations, and thus avoid default &ndash; for instance, if it holds long term debt. Many large companies operate permanently in this state. Insolvency is not a synonym for bankruptcy, which is a determination of insolvency made by a court of law with resulting legal orders intended to resolve the insolvency.

      <p>It is often the case that the best solution for insurmountable debt is personal bankruptcy. The law now provides that in most normal circumstances an individual bankrupt for the first time is automatically discharged from bankruptcy after only 12 months. In some cases it can be less!&nbsp; During that time you will be able to maintain a job and a bank account and such proportion of your income that is required to meet the reasonable needs of yourself and your family. Once your bankruptcy ends all of your debts (except for some specific ones such as secured debts, student loans and others) are gone.</p>
      It is likely that the number of bankruptcies during the next year will increase dramatically and therefore there should be no personal embarrassment or stigma attached to this solution. There are some restrictions on the activities you can undertake as a bankrupt however. Bankruptcy is not the only solution and so seeking the right advice at the right time is crucial.

    - These arrangements help you to avoid bankruptcy by entering into an agreement with your unsecured creditors. A proposal is put to your creditors (the people you owe) and if 75% of the value of debts owed vote in favour of the proposal then all of your unsecured debt is rolled into the arrangement. Normally you will then pay a monthly amount into your agreement usually for a period of 5 years and your creditors receive payment out of those sums. So long as you stick to the terms of the agreement once it comes to an end the debts will be satisfied in full notwithstanding the fact that you may not have actually paid 100% of what you owed. This solution also avoids bankruptcy and ensures your home is protected from any unsecured creditors.

      <li>being involved in your      children&rsquo;s health, education, and welfare</li>

      <h2>Break-up of a relationship</h2>
      <p>The law treats unmarried couples differently from married couples. Our knowledge of this complex area of law can help you resolve your problems following break-up with a cohabitation partner.</p>
      <p>Much can be done to protect your interests, including your financial assets.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If there are children from the relationship, we can help you to agree arrangements for them.</p>
      <h2>Cohabitation agreements</h2>
      <p><strong>Did you know that...</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li>There      is no such thing as a &ldquo;common law&rdquo; husband and wife? </li>
      <li>If a      co-habitee dies the survivor is not his or her &ldquo;next of kin&rdquo; and therefore      may have to go to court to claim all or any of the deceased&rsquo;s estate? </li>
      <li>You      may not automatically be responsible for any surviving children of the      relationship? </li>
      <li>A      co-habitee does not automatically acquire an interest in his or her      partner&rsquo;s property simply by living there for a certain period of time;      and that the law in this area is so complex that some Judges struggle to      make sense of it? </li>
      <li>Even      if you own property together, you may not own it equally (especially if it      was bought before 1996) and that a recent case has stated that, in certain      situations, the value of that house may not automatically be shared      equally between former co-habitees? </li>
      </ul>
      <p>A Cohabitation agreement can help remove some of the above uncertainties. If you are going to live with a partner but not marry, it is sensible to create an agreement which records your intentions about your assets and how you would share or divide them if your relationship broke up. We can draft an agreement which states your intentions and protects your financial assets.</p>

      <p>With high profile cases such as the Mills and McArtney raising the profile of acrimonious settlements, it is little surprise that couples thinking of marrying would now give consideration to some sort of pre marital prenuptial agreements.</p>
      <h2>Are pre or postnuptial agreements binding?</h2>
      <p>Prenuptial agreements are common place on mainland Europe but the courts in England and Wales have always been reluctant to have their overall discretion as to how assets should be divided upon divorce tied in by an agreement reached between two parties prior to the marriage taking place.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>A gradual shift towards recognising the validity of pre and post nuptial agreements was brought to a head by the case of <strong>Radmacher v. Grantino</strong>. This case went to the highest court in the land, The Supreme Court, purely on whether a pre-nuptial agreement entered into by the parties in Germany three months before they married was applicable in law in England and Wales.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court decided in October 2010 that it was natural to infer that parties entering into agreements of this sort will intend that legal effect would be given to those agreements. Unless the outcome of the pre-nuptial agreement was unfair to any children of the marriage, in which case the court could still ignore or vary the agreement, the agreement would be upheld by the court.</p>
      <h2>Who should consider a pre or post-marital/partnership agreement?</h2>
      <p>Agreements of this nature are particularly worth considering if:-</p>
      <ul>
      <li>One or both of the parties to the relationship      are more mature. </li>
      <li>Where this may be his second marriage or      partnership. </li>
      <li>Where one party brings significant assets to a      relationship or there is an imbalance in the financial provision to be      made by both parties. </li>
      <li>Where provision needs to be made for children or      dependants from a previous relationship. </li>
      <li>Where you wish to influence how assets may be      divided between you should the marriage or civil partnership fail.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <h2>When should we consider these types of agreements?</h2>
      <p>As soon as possible. The longer the agreement is in place prior to a marriage or civil partnership being entered into the better. However, agreements entered into after marriage or Civil Partnership can still have legal effect.&nbsp; In order for an agreement of this nature to be made binding there needs to be independent legal advice for both parties, full and frank financial disclosure and no duress.&nbsp; If a pre-nuptial agreement of this nature is entered into at the church door then it is open to an allegation that one party or the other has been under a level of duress to enter into the agreement.</p>
      <h2>How do I found out more?</h2>
      <p>Please contact any member of the family team who would be able to discuss the options available with you.</p>

      <h2>What are Civil Partnerships?</h2>
      <p>Civil partnerships are for adult same sex couples who are not in existing registered partnerships or marriage and are not closely related.&nbsp; Couples who register have legal status as &ldquo;registered civil partners&rdquo; and acquire a package of rights and responsibilities in the same way as a married couple.</p>
      <h2>What happens if my Civil Partnership does not work?</h2>
      <p>If the civil partnership breaks down then you can apply to the court to have the partnership brought to an end after you have been together as civil partners for at least one year.</p>
      <h2>How do I end my Civil Partnership?</h2>
      <p>Bringing the relationship to an end involves the similar process to having a divorce.&nbsp; A petition is filed asking that the partnership should be brought to a conclusion and showing that the partnership has definitely come to an end.&nbsp; The petition will need to be lodged with a County Court that specifically deals with dissolving civil partnerships.</p>
      <h2>What basis can the partnership be ended by the Court?</h2>
      <p>The court will accept similar grounds to prove that the relationship has come to an end as those of divorcing couples.&nbsp; The ground for dissolution is that the relationship has broken down irretrievably shown by the following facts:-</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Either that your civil      partner&rsquo;s behaviour has been so unreasonable you can no longer bear to      live with him or her;</li>
      <li>That you or your      civil partner have lived apart for at least two years immediately      preceding the presentation of the petition and your partner agrees to a dissolution;</li>
      <li>That you and your      civil partner have lived apart for at least five years prior to the      presentation of the petition and the partner&rsquo;s consent is not required, or;</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Your civil partner has deserted you.</li>
      </ol> <ol> </ol>
      <p>For a desertion petition you will need to have been apart for two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition.</p>
      <h2>Can I make financial claims against my civil partner if the partnership is brought to a conclusion?</h2>
      <p>Civil partners can make claims against each other&rsquo;s finances in the same way that heterosexual married couples can.&nbsp; If there are financial issues stemming from your separation and dissolution of the partnership you will need to take further detailed advice and we recommend that you contact one of the family team who can give you specific advice in relation to this complex area of law.</p>
      <h2>Are there any useful sites for me to look at?</h2>
      <p>We recommended you look at the following websites:-</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.stonewall.org.uk/">www.stonewall.org.uk</a></p>
      <p><a href="http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk">www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk</a> (to look at the paperwork involved in dissolving the civil partnership).</p>

      <p>Making a Will is commonly associated as something you do in later life however, in reality anyone over the age of 18 can have a Will and we would strongly recommend it to anyone with children.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wills are not for just sorting out finances and property in the event of your death, you can appoint guardians for your children and even leave money to your friends or a charity.&nbsp; Without a Will the government decides these things for you.&nbsp; Why not read the <a href="../../../page/wills"><span>10 reasons why you need a will</span></a>?</p>
      <h2>Would like to make a Will today?</h2>
      <p>Wills can vary from those requiring quite basic division of assets to fairly complex documents with trusts included.&nbsp; Whatever your circumstances we can advise you on the best type of Will to have and also give you advice on how to make it inheritance tax efficient.</p>
      <h2>Types of Wills</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Standard Will</li>
      <li>Mirror Will - indentical Wills for a couple</li>
      <li>Complex Will with trusts</li>
      </ul>
      Circumstances change over time so we advise that our clients review their Will every 5 years to ensure it still meets their needs. For example you may have moved house, gone through a divorce or maybe have had more Children/Grandchildren in that time.

      <p>Leaving money to charity in your Will can be a very satisfying thing to do, perhaps because they&rsquo;ve helped you or your loved ones in the past and you want to thank them for their hard work by leaving them a gift.</p>
      <p>You can decide to leave either a % of your final estate (once your family have been provided for) or you can specify the amount of money you wish to leave all gifts to charity in your Will are exempt from Inheritance Tax. These gifts are taken out of your estate before any inheritance tax is worked out, so there may be times when a gift to charity could substantially reduce the tax your estate.</p>
      <p>Individual circumstances vary but we are here to help you every step of the way.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We work in partnership with several different charities and you could help us to help them by leaving a gift in your Will.</p>

      <h2>We're with you every step of the way...</h2>
      <p>Losing a loved one is one of the most difficult times in our lives and now more than ever you need to know you are working with people who understand your situation and can advise you of the best way to proceed.</p>
      <p>If you have been appointed as someone&rsquo;s executor, it is often difficult at this distressing time to know what to do first. Briefly, the steps you need to take initially are:-</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Find the Will</li>
      <li>Register the death</li>
      <li>Arrange the funeral</li>
      <li>Secure the deceased&rsquo;s property</li>
      <li>Collect together all the paperwork you can find</li>
      </ol> Probate is an order of the Court giving one or more people the legal authority to administer the estate of the deceased in order to distribute it correctly to the beneficiaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <p><strong>To be able to administer the wishes set out in a Will you will need to apply for a Grant of Probate.&nbsp;</strong> If you have any asset worth over &pound;5,000, any stocks and shares or a property then your executors will usually need to apply for probate. If you don&rsquo;t make a Will, they need to apply for Letters of Administration instead, which is very similar. Unless your assets are all owned jointly with someone else and pass to them automatically, you will need Probate before your estate can be paid out. We can provide detailed advice about this if you need it.</p>
      With our Fixed Fee promise after discussing the case with you we will fix your fee so you know exactly what you will pay from the start.

      <h2><strong>What is Inheritance Tax?</strong><br /> <br /></h2>
      It is a tax payable on death at the rate of 40% on the value of your net assets over &pound;325,000*. The first &pound;325,000* is called the Nil Rate Band because although it is taxable to Inheritance Tax, it is taxed at 0%.
      <p>If you are married, the best way to pay less inheritance tax (or even none at all) is by making inheritance tax efficient Wills. This will need to be done face to face with a solicitor.</p>
      <h2>Here are some FAQs</h2>
      <p>1. Can&rsquo;t I just give some assets away, so I leave less than the Nil Rate Band when I die?<br /> If you give away large amounts of money, or valuable assets whilst you are alive, you must survive this gift for 7 years otherwise the Inland Revenue will tax you as if you still owned them when you die. This is the case whether you make the gift to an individual or put it into some types of trust.</p>
      <p>If you put your money or assets into certain types of trust or give them to a company, however, there is an immediate charge to inheritance tax &ndash; even though you are still alive.</p>
      <p>2. So, I can&rsquo;t give anything away whilst I am alive unless I survive for 7 years?<br /> There are certain gifts you can make which are not subject to this 7 year rule. Everyone has an &ldquo;annual exemption&rdquo; for inheritance tax of &pound;3,000 each every tax year. That means you can give away &pound;3,000 in total every tax year and it immediately falls out of your estate for inheritance tax purposes. If you die within 7 years, that gift will not be brought back into account. If you haven&rsquo;t used your annual exemption one year, you can roll it forward for 1 tax year, so you can give away &pound;6,000 the next year. You can only do this once, however.</p>
      <p>All gifts to UK charity, registered housing associations, qualifying political parties, national museums and universities are also exempt form inheritance tax altogether, whether you give to them under your Will or during your lifetime.</p>
      <p>If your children or grandchildren get married, you can give them or their new spouse a lump sum of &pound;5,000 or &pound;2,500 respectively, completely free of inheritance tax.</p>
      <p>You can give any amount to your own spouse free of inheritance tax (provided you are both domiciled in England and Wales) although you should seek legal advice before doing so, as this could affect other tax planning possibilities.</p>
      <p>There are other gifts which are exempt from inheritance tax &ndash; please telephone or call into one of our offices to arrange an appointment and we will be happy to discuss these further.</p>
      3. If I do decide to give a large amount to my children now, is there anything I can do to reduce the tax?<br /> You can insure the inheritance tax liability which would arise if you were to die within 7 years of the gift. Please ask for more information and one of our specialist advisers will be delighted to explain how this works and, if you wish, put you in touch with a trusted financial expert to help you choose the right policy for you.

      <p>A trust means that you assign responsibility of the finances over to a trustee. This can be quite a demanding role and you should know what&rsquo;s involved before agreeing to become a trustee.</p>
      <p>Trustees have various duties and powers which are given to them either by the general law, the Trust deed (or Will) or a combination of both. It is essential that a Trustee understands the duties imposed on him and the powers available.</p>
      <p>If there is more than one Trustee they must act unanimously. Loosely:-</p>
      <p>"<strong>Duties</strong>" are <strong>obligations</strong> imposed on Trustees instructing them to do certain things. "<strong>Powers</strong>" are <strong>permissions</strong>, allowing the Trustees to do certain things.</p>
      <p>It is essential to consult the Trust Deed (or Will) itself to see what the powers and duties of a particular trust will be.</p>
      <p>Trustees manage Trust Funds on behalf of the <strong>Settlor</strong> (the person who sets up the Trust), for the benefit of the <strong>Beneficiaries</strong>. The Trustees must make sure that their actions are in the best interests of <em>all</em> the Beneficiaries. The Beneficiaries have the power to make sure the Trustees are doing so and they may take legal action against the Trustees if they act outside the terms of the Trust.</p>
      <p>All Trustees must be over 18 and mentally capable. They should ideally also have a sound financial history. It is possible for a Beneficiary to also be a Trustee but this can give rise to a conflict of interest. There is no limit to the number of Trustees a particular Trust can have (with the exception of land, where there cannot be more than 4 trustees), but it is strongly advised that there be at least 2. It is possible for a Trustee to retire but the other Trustee(s) must agree to this. It is not possible for you to retire if you are the only Trustee unless someone else is appointed to act in your place. Trustees should also remember that even after retiring they can still be held responsible for their actions before retirement.</p>
      <p>There are some circumstances in which a Trustee can be removed against their Will, for example if they are made bankrupt or remain outside the UK for more than 12 months or refuse to carry out their duties.</p>
      <h2>Duty to act impartially</h2>
      <p>The Trustees must invest the Trust Fund and generally administer the Trust in accordance with the Trust deed (or Will) and may take into account any letter of wishes. They must act fairly and impartially towards all the beneficiaries and must not benefit one beneficiary at the expense of another. They should treat all beneficiaries of the same class equally and of different classes fairly.</p>
      <h2>Duty to secure trust property</h2>
      <p>For example, this might mean that the Trustees would have to recover a debt owed to the Trust.</p>
      <h2>Duty to keep records</h2>
      <p>Trustees must keep records of what they do as they need these to prove that Trust has been properly managed. This includes keeping accounts, minutes of meetings and all other Trust documents. They must also allow inspection of these records by the Beneficiaries.</p>
      <h2>Duty not to benefit themselves</h2>
      <p>The Trustees must not make a profit out of the Trust for themselves &ndash; they must act as volunteers (although there is a power for professional Trustees to charge, as set out below). They must not profit either directly or indirectly, although this rule can be expressly excluded in the Trust deed (or Will).</p>
      <h2>Duty to enquire of Trust property</h2>
      <p>In other words, the Trustees must find out what assets are in the Trust, take control of them and ensure their preservation.</p>
      <h2>Duty to act with reasonable care and skill</h2>
      <p>Whenever the Trustees carry out certain functions (such as the power to invest, as set out below) there is a statutory duty on them to act with reasonable care and skill. The duty takes into account whether the Trustee is a professional and the level of knowledge and experience which he has or ought reasonably to have. Consequently, higher standards will be expected of investment professionals than of lay people.</p>
      <h2>Duty to keep investments under review</h2>
      <p>All the duties imposed on the Trustees require them to carefully consider the circumstances of the Trust, its Beneficiaries and investments on a regular basis. It is very important that every Trustee is actively involved in the administration of the Trust and in particular in the investment decisions. It is not sufficient for a Trustee to simply leave the decisions to his co-Trustees or for all the Trustees to simply leave the Trust investments in one place from year to year. They will need to hold a formal review and record the reasons for their decisions, at least once every year.</p>
      <p>A Trustee&rsquo;s powers will usually be contained in the Trust deed (or Will) itself and can be very wide-ranging. There are also powers given by the general law (unless they are excluded or amended by the Trust deed (or Will)):-</p>
      <h2>Power of Investment</h2>
      <p>Trustees have the same powers as an individual would have in relation to assets. To balance this power, the Trustees must have regard to:-</p>
      <ol>
      <li>The need for      diversification&nbsp; and the suitability of the Trust&rsquo;s investments;</li>
      <li>The duty to keep      investments under review; and</li>
      <li>The need to obtain and      consider &ldquo;proper advice&rdquo; when making a reviewing investments.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Power to delegate</h2>
      <p>The law allows Trustees to delegate to an agent (such as an accountant or solicitor) any of their functions including the powers of investment. There are, however, 4 areas which cannot be delegated:-</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Dispositive powers (i.e.      those relating to the distribution of Trust property);</li>
      <li>Power to decide whether      payments should be made out of income or capital;</li>
      <li>Power of appointing new      Trustees;</li>
      <li>Power of delegation itself.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Where Trustees delegate to an agent providing asset management services, the law requires a written statement called a <strong>Policy Statement</strong>, providing guidance to the agent as to how the Trust assets are to be managed. The agent&rsquo;s performance against this Policy Statement must be reviewed regularly.</p>
      <h2>Power to insure</h2>
      <p>Trustees may insure in full of the Trust property as if the property were their own. Insurance premiums can be paid out of income or capital of the Trust fund. It will not always be appropriate to insure Trust property, for example where the cost outweighs the benefit, but if the Trustees decide not to insure then they should set out their reasons for this decision, preferably in writing. They would then not be liable for any loss incurred.</p>

      <p>Property disputes can be very stressful as they often arise when a building job has not been completed properly or maybe you are rowing with a neighbour over a boundary fence?&nbsp;&nbsp; Our expertise in the complex area of building disputes applies a sound commercial approach to achieving a resolution whether you are an individual, or a construction company.</p>
      <p>Starting with the contract you entered into, we identify the essential elements of the dispute.</p>
      <p>We can&nbsp; help you with claims concerning:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>failure to carry out or complete building work</li>
      <li>Defective construction</li>
      <li>disputes over costs</li>
      <li>Boundary disputes on your land</li>
      <li>Ownership disputes </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We can act either in the defence of the building company, or for individuals and businesses that are in dispute with builders</p>
      We can also advise you in creating a professional contract with a builder at the start of a job so that if things turn bad you have a legally binding contract to fall back on.

      <h2>What is a Notary Public?</h2>
      <p>A Notary is a qualified lawyer with a specialist additional qualification, appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The rules which affect Notaries are very similar to the rules which affect Solicitors.</p>
      <h2>What can a Notary do?</h2>
      <p>A Notary&rsquo;s work normally involves the preparation and authentication of documents for use abroad, Notaries are recognised internationally, unlike Solicitors.</p>
      <p>Many notaries do work for commercial firms engaged in international trade, and for private individuals. The most common tasks are:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Preparing and witnessing powers of attorney for      use overseas </li>
      <li>Dealing with purchase or sale of land and      property abroad </li>
      <li>Providing documents to deal with the      administration of the estate of people who are abroad, or owning property      abroad </li>
      <li>Authenticating personal documents and information      for immigration or emigration purposes, or to work abroad </li>
      <li>Authenticating company and business documents and      transactions</li>
      <li>Dealing with documents for weddings abroad</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Preparing to see a Notary</h2>
      <p>Although every case will be different, you will need to ensure:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>You make an appointment</li>
      <li>You bring evidence of your identity to the      appointment, such as at least a current valid passport and driving licence</li>
      <li>You understand any documents involved,      particularly if it is not in English</li>
      <li>You bring any documents to the appointment that      are relevant to the matter</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What is the cost?</h2>
      <p>The fee will be based upon the amount of time that is spent dealing with your matter, however a quotation will be provided in advance.</p>
      <p>If you would like to make an appointment or for further information, please contact Stephen Gordon on 01246 560560 or <a href="mailto:sg@bannerjones.co.uk?">sg@bannerjones.co.uk</a>.</p>

      <p>Research shows that &ldquo;it's not that your divorce or separation that most affects your children; it's how you do it that does&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>Collaborative Family Law offers you a fresh approach to how family breakdown is dealt with and rather than dealing through solicitors, you work with them to find a solution best for you and your family.</p>
      <h2>Testimonials</h2>
      <p>&ldquo;I found the process as amicable as could have been expected and would recommend it where there are children involved as it appears to have had minimal effect on my son. The extra time involved was well worth it in order to maintain a civil relationship with my wife during this period&rdquo;&nbsp; - Mr. L, Sheffield.</p>
      <h2>How is Collaborative Law different?</h2>
      <p>Couples who work Collaboratively sign an agreement not to go to court but to meet face to face to discuss reaching a fair and balanced outcome. The benefit of a non-court based process is it allows you;</p>
      <ul>
      <li>To control the pace, timescale and outcome of your discussions</li>
      <li>To find a solution bespoke to your own circumstances</li>
      <li>To give careful consideration to complicated business, family business or investment interests</li>
      <li>To work with other specialist advisers such as accountants, financial advisers and pension experts jointly with your partner if required</li>
      <li>To keep things as amicable as possible (which is particularly important where there are children involved)</li>
      <li>To avoid conflict and deal with your seperation in a dignified manner</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What is involved?<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></h2>
      <p>The process is based upon each party having their own Collaboratively trained lawyer. Progress is made in a series of four-way meetings, face to face, sat round the table. There are no letters or phone calls except to arrange the meetings and to circulate the minutes of those meetings. Both parties and their Collaborative lawyers as well as making a commitment not to go to court, agree to a set of basic ground rules. Negotiations are based upon full financial disclosure, and when needed, other jointly instructed neutral professionals (such as accountants) can be brought in to assist in the process. Solutions are based upon the parties&rsquo; interests and needs rather than conflicting positions. Sometimes only a couple of meetings are needed, sometimes four or five. These meetings can be close together or widely spaced depending upon your individual circumstances. The choice is yours. Once agreement is reached, your Collaborative lawyer will make it binding for you and put the agreement into effect. For couples and families who genuinely seek a fair solution and want to mimimise the pain of family breakdown, Collaborative Law may offer the best approach.</p>

      <p>Believe it or not the way you own your property is very important if you want to leave a share of it to somebody in your Will. For example:</p>
      <h2>Owning as "Joint Tenants"</h2>
      <p>This way, neither of you owns an identifiable share of the property. You collectively own the whole thing - essentially you hold it on trust for yourselves. This means that when one of you dies, the property automatically passes to the survivor(s). It does not matter whether or not the deceased co-owner had a Will.</p>
      <h2>Owning as "Tenants in Common"</h2>
      <p>By owning this way, you each own an identifiable share of the property. Unless you have stated otherwise, this will be 50% each for 2 owners or one third each for 3 owners etc. You are each free to use your share in any way you want. You can give it away during your lifetime, or can leave it to someone under your Will. Owning as Tenants in Common, the property will not automatically pass to the surviving owner(s) so it is <em>vital</em> that you each have a Will.</p>
      <p>Why is it important to own the right way?<br /> You MUST own the property as Tenants in Common if you want to:-</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Give your share to someone      else</li>
      <li>Leave your share under your      Will</li>
      <li>Put your share into trust      for someone else&rsquo;s benefit</li>
      <li>Engage in any inheritance      tax planning</li>
      <li>Plan for future care fees</li>
      <li>Have extra flexibility in      dealing with your assets</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <p>1. How do I know which way I jointly own the property?<br /> If you don&rsquo;t know, the chances are you own as joint tenants. However, we can easily check this for you. All we need is to see your title deeds.</p>
      <p>2. Can I change the way I own the property?<br /> It is very simple to change from joint tenants to tenants in common. We would be happy to prepare the necessary paperwork and register the change at HM Land Registry on your behalf.</p>
      <p>3. If we already own as Tenants in Common, can we change the shares we each own?<br /> We would be happy to prepare the deed necessary to do this and can provide an estimate of costs on application</p>
      <h2>Equity Release Schemes<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></h2>
      <p><strong>What is &ldquo;Equity Release&rdquo;?</strong><br /> There are various schemes which allow you to release some of the value (&ldquo;equity&rdquo;) of your home. They allow you to obtain either a lump sum or a regular income or both without having to move home. There are a variety of different schemes available and you will need expert legal and financial advice if you are considering this as an option.</p>
      <p>Equity Release schemes have earned a poor reputation in former years, but the regime is now much more regulated than it was. We would still strongly advise you to seek proper legal and financial advice before considering it.</p>
      <p><strong>Is it suitable for me?</strong><br /> To be eligible for any of the schemes available, you must generally speaking:-</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Be aged at least 60</li>
      <li>Own your own home</li>
      <li>Have paid off all or almost      all of any existing mortgage over the property</li>
      <li>Own a property worth at      least &pound;40,000</li>
      <li>Own a property built out of      brick or stone</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What different schemes are available?<br /> The schemes fall under 2 broad headings: &ldquo;Reversion Schemes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lifetime Mortgage Schemes&rdquo;. Each type will have advantages and disadvantages.</p>
      <h2>Reversion Schemes</h2>
      <p>These schemes involve you selling all or part of your home to a Reversion Company. In return, you receive a lump sum or a monthly income. You and your partner can stay in the home, usually rent free, for the rest of your lives. When the property is eventually sold (usually on the 2nd death), the Reversion Company receives a % of the sale proceeds equal to the % of the property that they bought from you.</p>
      <h2>Lifetime Mortgage Schemes</h2>
      <p>This heading covers a variety of different mortgage schemes, all of which involve you borrowing money secured on the value of your home. Again, you can receive either a lump sum or a monthly income. You continue to own all of your home and the loan is repaid to the lender when your home is sold. You can choose whether to make interest payments or whether the interest is &ldquo;rolled up&rdquo; and paid back when the property is sold.</p>
      <h2>What will it cost?</h2>
      <p>There are all sorts of &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; costs including:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Completion, arrangement or      application fees </li>
      <li>Valuation fees</li>
      <li>Insurance</li>
      <li>Early repayment charges</li>
      <li>Legal fees</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Other considerations</h2>
      <p>You should also consider the following:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>If your circumstances      change in future, will you be able to move home?</li>
      <li>Any equity release scheme      will affect the inheritance you are able to leave to your children or      grandchildren</li>
      <li>There could be implications      for your entitlement to social security benefits</li>
      <li>Who will be responsible for      repairs and maintenance of the property?</li>
      <li>Tax implications</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Is Equity Release right for me?</h2>
      <p>It may be that you could consider other options instead, such as moving to a smaller property or cashing in other &ldquo;nest eggs&rdquo;, such as premium bonds or savings.</p>
      <h2>How can I find out more?</h2>
      <p>If you are considering releasing some of the equity in your home, please book an appointment and we will be happy to discuss your options. We can meet you with your financial adviser if you wish, to make sure the advice is integrated. If you do not already have a financial adviser, we would be happy to recommend a specialist, independent adviser who can discuss your circumstances in detail.</p>

      <p>A Lasting Power of Attorney is created to allow someone else the ability to look after your affairs if your mental capacity is lost. There may be a variety of reasons why you might need to look after someone else&rsquo;s affairs and there are several ways of ensuring that you are acting properly.&nbsp;More often than not people create Lasting Powers of Attorney in later life when there is a higher chance of mental capacity being lost through dementia for example.&nbsp; However, mental capacity can be lost at any age as a result of say, an accident so we would also advise anyone with complex financial affairs to have one as well.</p>
      <p>At Banner Jones we can advise you on the best course of action for your particular circumstances.</p>
      <p>One of our most frequent questions would be:</p>
      <p>My father is elderly and has said that he would prefer me to deal with his bills and finances for him. Can I do this?</p>
      <p>As long as your father has mental capacity he could do this by giving you &ldquo;power of attorney&rdquo; which will allow you to look after things for up to a year for him. If he later loses mental capacity, however, then the power of attorney will come to an end.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, your father could give you Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA). This would not come to an end if your father were to lose mental capacity later on, and will last indefinitely, not just for one year. We would need to see your father personally so we can explain the LPA to him and make sure this is what he wants. We would then be able to prepare a document for him to sign, which would give you power to deal with his finances on his behalf.</p>
      <p>We will tailor-make the LPA to suit your father&rsquo;s wishes and we can discuss his options with him at the initial appointment. It cannot be used until it is registered with the Office of the Public Guardian, and we would be happy to deal with this too.</p>
      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <p>1. My aunt only has one bank account. Can I deal with this on her behalf?</p>
      <p>If the bank allows, it is possible for your aunt to name you as a third party on her bank account. This will allow you to withdraw funds and sign cheques on her behalf. We can help your aunt complete the mandate form required to put this in place.</p>
      <p>2. My aunt also receives state benefits. Is it possible for me to collect these on her behalf as well?</p>
      <p>It is often possible for you to be named as &ldquo;appointee&rdquo; to receive your aunt&rsquo;s benefits on her behalf. Again, we can help your aunt to complete the forms required for this</p>
      <p>3. My mother has dementia and would not be able to tell you who she wants to look after her affairs. What can I do?</p>
      <p>If your mother is not able to make a decision as to who she wishes to look after her affairs herself, and you are willing to take on this role, then we can apply to the Court for Deputyship. This would mean that you would be appointed by the Court to be your mother&rsquo;s Deputy.</p>
      <p>We will guide you through the whole process including giving the Court details of your mother&rsquo;s financial situation. As the Court requires we will also notify other members of her family of the application.</p>
      <p>Once the Court has all of the information they will consider the application and if they believe that you are suitable to manage your mother&rsquo;s affairs then they will appoint you as her Deputy. You will then be responsible for dealing with all of her finances, under the guidance of the Court.</p>
      <p>This means you can pay her bills, provide for her day-to-day needs and take care of any problems that arise. You must keep careful records of everything you do on behalf of your mother and we can help you prepare the annual accounts required by the Court.</p>
      <h2>What do I do next?</h2>
      <p>We are always keen to find the best solution possible for your particular circumstances, and we know that no two families are the same. Whatever your circumstances you can telephone us or make an appointment to discuss your situation with us in more detail. We will then be able advise you as to the best way forward.</p>

      <p>Succession is the Transfer of ownership and/or management<strong> </strong>of the business to the next generation.&nbsp; As a business grows, over the years a generation gap will more than likely appear.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Typically the 1<sup>st</sup> generation will be one or more close family members, often of a similar age.&nbsp; The 2<sup>nd</sup> generation will be their children and the 3<sup>rd</sup> generation could be the cousins, possibly with a wide range of ages and the family ties not as close as siblings so overall the ownership becomes more fragmented.</p>
      <h2>Gift of Business</h2>
      <p>Some owners come under pressure from the next generation who think that it is their &ldquo;right&rdquo; to be given the business, but in some cases such a Gift may mean that the current generation of owners do not have sufficient funds to retire.</p>
      <p>There are many questions about surrounding gifting the business, such as:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Who do you give shares to?</li>
      <li>Do you treat all children equally?</li>
      <li>Does fairly mean equally?</li>
      <li>What about those who are not involved in the business now?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Are you a custodian for the next generation?</li>
      <li>Should you expect to gift the business on? </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We can help you with the answers to these questions.</p>
      <h2>Sale of Business</h2>
      <p>Selling the business provides the opportunity for the current generation to realise the value and have the funds to retire. It also provides opportunity for the current generation to share proceeds with family members who are not participating in next generation.&nbsp; But how do you agree a fair price? What is affordable? It could open up the opportunity for other non-family management to participate in ownership i.e. a Management Buy Out.</p>
      <h2>Gradual handover</h2>
      <p>When the current generation of owners accept that it is time to step back, for some businesses a more gradual handover may be appropriate. A gradual handover allows the current owners to be paid out over time which maybe better for the business financially and it also gives chance for younger family members to start getting involved in the business.</p>
      <p>You might also consider a transfer of management before ownership. This would allow a balance between outright transfer and retaining some management control. You might want to ensure the next generation have the capability to run the business before handing it over and losing control altogether.</p>
      <p>We can advise you and help you understand when voting control has transferred on a gradual handover.</p>
      <h2>Other things to consider in Succession planning</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Every      adult should have a Will &ndash; if you own a business then this is essential to      plan for unexpected events. If there are minor children involved then      consider if the business can continue to be run by trustees in the future?</li>

      <p>A family charter is a none legally binding<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>agreement between family members regulating their conduct in respect of the family business. It is NOT an agreement which prevents the business&rsquo;s management team from managing the business.</p>
      <p>It can include anything and everything!</p>
      <p>It might specify who counts as family, e.g. Spouses/civil partners? Non-married &ldquo;partners&rdquo;?</p>
      <p>It might say who can join the business from outside of the family and what their roles, treatment and remuneration might be.</p>
      <p>It might specify Share ownership and Trusts. They can be also be quite useful in laying out the values of the business and future strategic business plans.</p>
      The process of negotiating the family charter (providing it is managed by an expert) can be invaluable in shaping structure for the future of the business, expectations, aspirations and any inclusion of non-participating family members.

      <p>There are different types of remuneration that can be considered including salaries for working employees and bonuses or dividends for owners.&nbsp;&nbsp; The big question we hear is often about how much to pay. It is often hard to balance between a fair salary for active and non-active members of the family.&nbsp; We hear stories about families working hard to pay dividends to siblings who don&rsquo;t contribute to the business.&nbsp; We also hear about family members receiving a higher than market rate salary so as to ensure a comfortable lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Taxation</h2>
      <p>We often see tax inefficiencies from owners who would rather be paid a larger salary to avoid sharing dividends with siblings.&nbsp; All this does is simply result in a larger tax bill.&nbsp; Beware of paying a &ldquo;salary&rdquo; to a family member who doesn&rsquo;t work &ndash; the Inland Revenue will&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Employee rights &ndash; suing your children/parents for unfair dismissal</p>
      <h2>Outsiders</h2>
      <p>You need to pay the market rate for new recruits, particularly if at a senior level who have little prospect of ever becoming owners.&nbsp; You should also be aware of the potential conflict between higher paid family members in more junior roles. This can be quite frustrating for non-family employees who work just as hard as the family member.&nbsp;&nbsp; A formal bonus scheme might be a way to equal out the remuneration among all staff.</p>

      <p><span>This is a process where a proposal is put to the company&rsquo;s creditors and if 75% of the value of those who vote are in favour of the proposal then all of the company&rsquo;s unsecured debt is rolled into the arrangement. Normally the company will then pay a monthly amount for a period of 5 years to satisfy the debt in full. More often than not the total amount paid is less than the total amount owed.</span></p>
      <p><span>This can be a very effective solution and avoids the company going into any form of liquidation. Therefore it continues as a going concern and its trading position need not be effected. Often the voluntary arrangement includes the appointment of a company Administrator and therefore often people associate this process with Administration.</span></p>

    - <p><span>Where a company has passed the point of no return it is often better to place the company into liquidation and bring it to an end. Often the company will have a business and assets which can be sold to a new company and therefore a &ldquo;Phoenix&rdquo; new company can purchase the business and assets and trade free of the old debt. This is a process which is frequently used and entirely in accordance with the Insolvency Act 1986.</span></p>

      <p><strong><span>Partnership/Individual Voluntary Arrangements</span></strong></p>
      <p><span>Where debt is held personally rather than in a limited company name it can be more troublesome. This is principally for the reason that the personal assets of the business owner, including their home, can be under threat. </span></p>
      <p><span>A partnership voluntary arrangement is used where there are more than one business owners trading in partnership and an individual voluntary arrangement is used for one person alone. Equally a series of individual voluntary arrangements can be used and this can often be the case in relation to either business partners or other partners. </span></p>
      <p><span>In the same way as a company voluntary arrangement 75% of the value of those who vote need to vote in favour of any proposal. Most proposals again involve monthly payments over a 5 year period after which time the debt is discharged in full. It is not normal to use this solution if the debts are for less than &pound;15,000. It is a useful tool as it avoids bankruptcy and protects personal assets.</span></p>
